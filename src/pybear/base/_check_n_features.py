) -> int:
    """Set the `n_features_in_` attribute, or check against it.

    pybear recommends calling `reset=True` in `fit` and in the first
    call to `partial_fit`. All other methods that validate `X` should
    set `reset=False`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : XContainer of shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples,)
        The input data, with a 'shape' attribute.
    n_features_in_ : Union[int, None]
        The number of features in the data. If this attribute exists,
        it is an integer. If it does not exist, it is None.
    reset : bool
        If True:
            The `n_features_in_` attribute is set to `X.shape[1]`.

        If False:
            If `n_features_in_` exists check it is equal to `X.shape[1]`.

            If `n_features_in_` does *not* exist the check is skipped.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError:
        If `X` has no columns (is empty along the column axis).

        If `reset=False` and the number of features in `X` does not equal
            `n_features_in_`.

    Returns
    -------
    n_features : int
        The number of features in `X`.
