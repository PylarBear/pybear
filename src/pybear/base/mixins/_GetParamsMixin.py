        The 'instance' may be a pybear estimator, transformer, or a
        gridsearch module that wraps a nested estimator or pipeline.

        Parameters
        ----------
        deep : Optional[bool], default=True
            For instances that do not have nested instances in an
            `estimator` attribute (such as estimators or transformers),
            this parameter is ignored and the same (full) set of
            parameters for the instance is returned regardless of the
            value of this parameter.

            For instances that have nested instances (such as a
            GridSearch instance with a nested estimator or pipeline) in
            the `estimator` attribute, `deep=False` will only return the
            parameters for the wrapping instance. For example, a
            GridSearch module wrapping an estimator will only return
            parameters for the GridSearch instance, ignoring the
            parameters of the nested instance. When `deep=True`, this
            method returns the parameters of the wrapping instance as
            well as the parameters of the nested instance. When the
            nested instance is a single estimator, the full set of
            parameters for the single estimator are returned in addition
            to the parameters of the wrapping instance. If the nested
            object is a pipeline, the parameters of the pipeline and the
            parameters of each of the steps in the pipeline are returned
            in addition to the parameters of the wrapping instance. The
            estimator's parameters are prefixed with `estimator__`.

        Returns
        -------
        params : dict[str, Any]
            Parameter names mapped to their values.

        # the class. This modules uses the python builtin 'vars' to get
        # all the params of a class, whether it be a single estimator,
        # GSCV, or pipeline. get_params presents all params in
        # alphabetical order, which is not native vars behavior, there
        # must be a sort step. All params with leading and trailing
        # underscores are removed. This is what is returned in paramsdict
        # for single estimators whether deep == True or False. This is
        # also what is returned when deep is False for GSCV and pipelines.

        # params of the wrapper are returned as well as

        # does matter if the embedded is a pipeline. For deep=True, and
        # sorting the params in ascending alphabetical order, paramsdict
