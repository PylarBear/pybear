class FeatureMixin:
    """This mixin manages feature names for pybear transformers and
    estimators.

    It is able to collect feature names from data containers, validate
    them, and provides access points for users. This mixin provides
    the `get_feature_names_out` method of the pybear API to pybear
    transformers.

    The `get_feature_names_out` method returns the features names that
    correspond to the output of `transform`. This particular method can
    only be used for transformers that do not alter the feature axis,
    that is, the feature name output is one-to-one with the feature name
    input. If the transformer does alter the feature axis of the data,
    then a dedicated `get_feature_names_out` method will need to be used
    in place of this one.

    If you are trying to use this to build your own estimator or
    transformer, it is probably better to explore this mixin in the
    source code, because of hidden methods and documentation not exposed
    in the online docs.

            names were not seen on the first fit.
        reset : bool
            Whether to reset the `feature_names_in_` attribute. If False,
            the feature names of `X` will be checked for consistency with
            feature names of data provided when reset was last True.
