# called by the _check_feature_names method of BaseEstimator, which in
# turn is called by the _validate_data method of BaseEstimator
def get_feature_names(X: Any):
    """Get feature names from `X`.

    `X` must have a 'columns' attribute or a '__dataframe__' dunder,
    i.e., follows the dataframe interchange protocol. Otherwise, feature
    names are not retrieved and None is returned. If the dataframe does
    not have a header comprised of strings (the dataframe was constructed
    without passing a header and a default non-string header is used),
    a warning is raised and None is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, )
        Array container from which to extract feature names.

        Objects that have known compatibility with this module: pandas
        dataframe and, polars dataframe. The columns will be considered
        to be feature names. If the dataframe contains non-string feature
        names, None is returned.

        All other array containers will return 'None'. Examples of
        containers known to not yield feature names: numpy arrays and
        scipy sparse matrices / arrays.

    Returns
    -------
    feature_names : Union[numpy.ndarray[object], None]
        The feature names of `X`. Unrecognized array containers return
        None.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pybear.base import get_feature_names
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> data = np.random.uniform(0, 1, (5, 3))
    >>> X = pd.DataFrame(data=data, columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])
    >>> out = get_feature_names(X)
    >>> print(out)
    ['A' 'B' 'C']
