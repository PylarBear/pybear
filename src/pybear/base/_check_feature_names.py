    X: Any,
    feature_names_in_: Union[npt.NDArray[object], None],
    reset: bool
) -> Union[npt.NDArray[object], None]:
    """Set or check the `feature_names_in_` attribute.

    pybear recommends setting `reset=True` in :meth:`fit` and in the
    first call to :meth:`partial_fit`. All other methods that validate
    `X` should set `reset=False`.

    If reset is True:
        Get the feature names from `X` and return. If `X` does not have
        valid string feature names, return None. `feature_names_in_`
        passed as a parameter to the function does not matter.

    If reset is False:
        When `feature_names_in_` exists and the checks of this module
        are satisfied then `feature_names_in_` is always returned.

        If `feature_names_in_` exists (a header was seen on first fit) and:
            `X` has a header:
            Validate that the feature names of `X` have the exact names
            and order as those seen during fit. If they are equal, return
            the feature names; if they are not equal, raise ValueError.

            `X` does not have a header:
            Warn and return `feature_names_in_`.

        If `feature_names_in_` does not exist and the checks of this
        module are satisfied then None is always returned regardless of
        any header that the current `X` may have.

        If `feature_names_in_` does not exist (a header was not seen on
        first fit) and:

            `X` has a header:  Warn and return None.

            `X` does not have a header: return None

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array_like of shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, )
        The data from which to extract feature names. `X` will provide
        feature names if it is a dataframe constructed with a valid
        header of strings. Some objects that are known to yield feature
        names are pandas and polars dataframes. If `X` does not have a
        valid header then None is returned. Objects that are known to
        not yield feature names are numpy arrays and scipy sparse
        matrices/arrays.                  .
    feature_names_in_ : numpy.ndarray[object] of shape (n_features, )
        The feature names seen on the first fit, if an object with a
        valid header was passed on the first fit. None if feature names
        were not seen on the first fit.
    reset : bool
        Whether to reset the `feature_names_in_` attribute. If False,
        the feature names of `X` will be checked for consistency with
        feature names of data provided when reset was last True.

    Returns
    -------
    feature_names_in_ : Union[numpy.ndarray[object], None]
        The validated feature names if feature names were seen the last
        time reset was set to True. None if the estimator/transformer
        did not see valid feature names at the first fit.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pybear.base import check_feature_names
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.random.randint(0, 10, (5, 3))
    >>> feature_names_in_ = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> X = pd.DataFrame(data=data, columns=list('abc'))

    # Verify accepts a valid header and returns it
    >>> check_feature_names(X, feature_names_in_=feature_names_in_, reset=False)
    array(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype='<U1')
