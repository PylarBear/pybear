    """Return the feature name vector for the output of a pybear
    estimator or transformer.

    - If `input_features` is None, then `feature_names_in_` is
      used as the feature names. If `feature_names_in_` is not defined,
      then the following input feature names are generated:
      '["x0", "x1", ..., "x(`n_features_in_` - 1)"]'.
    - If `input_features` is an array-like, then `input_features` must
      match `feature_names_in_` if `feature_names_in_` is defined.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_features : Union[Sequence[str], None]
        Input features.
    feature_names_in_ : Union[numpy.ndarray[object], None]
        The names of the features as seen during fitting. Only available
        if `X` is passed to `partial_fit` or `fit` in a container that
        has a header.
    n_features_in_ : numbers.Integral
        The number of features in `X`.

    Returns
    -------
    _feature_names_out : numpy.ndarray[object]
        The feature names for the transformed output.
