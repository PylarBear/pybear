) -> npt.NDArray[np.int32]:
    """Map a vector of feature names `feature_names` against the full set
    of feature names provided by `feature_names_in`.

    Return the index positions of the given feature names with respect
    to their position in `feature_names_in`. Can be returned as positive
    indices, e.g. [0,3,4], or negative indices, e.g. [-4,-2,-1], or as
    given.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_names : Union[Sequence[str], Sequence[int], None]
        The feature names to be mapped to index positions. If None,
        returns None. If an empty 1D sequence, returns the same. If
        passed as integers without a `feature_names_in` reference,
        returns the original. if passed as integers with a
        `feature_names_in` reference, the index values are validated
        against the dimensions of the `feature_names_in` vector and
        mapped to all positive or all negative values based on `positive`.
        If passed as strings without a `feature_names_in` reference,
        raises exception. If passed as strings with a `feature_names_in`
        reference, the string values are mapped to the index positions
        in the `feature_names_in` vector and mapped to all positive or
        all negative values based on `positive`. If passed as string
        values and a value is not in `feature_names_in`, raises exception.
    feature_names_in : Union[Sequence[str], None]
        If not None, a 1D list-like containing strings that are the
        feature names of a data-bearing container.
    positive : Union[bool, None]
        Whether to return the mapped indices as all positive or all
        negative integers. if None, leave the indices as is.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : numpy.ndarray[np.int32]
        The given feature names mapped to index positions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pybear.utilities import feature_name_mapper
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.random.randint(0, 10, (5, 3))
    >>> columns = np.array(['A', 'B', 'C'])
    >>> feature_names = np.array(['A', 'C'])
    >>> out = feature_name_mapper(
    ...     feature_names, columns, positive=False
    ... )
    >>> print(out)
    [-3 -1]
