def union_find(
    pairs: Sequence[Sequence[Any]]
) -> tuple[tuple[Any, Any], ...]:
    """Use the union-find algorithm to find groups of connected values
    from disjoint pairs of connected values.

    Requires an sequence list-like container holding sequence list-like
    pairs of values. The contents of the pairs are not validated, but
    must be hashable by a Python dictionary and must be compatible with
    Python '==' and '!=' operators. Python lists and tuples are tested
    and recommended, though other list-like containers such as sets and
    numpy arrays are likely to work. The output is not sorted in any way;
    any sorting needs to be done external to `union_find`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pairs : Sequence[Sequence[Any]]
        Disjoint pairs of connected values.

    Returns
    -------
    _connected : tuple[tuple[Any, ...], ...]
        The unions of the disjoint pairs of connected values into groups
        of mutually connected values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pybear.utilities import union_find
    >>> pairs = [(0, 4), (7, 3), (5, 9), (5, 4), (3, 8)]
    >>> out = union_find(pairs)
    >>> print(out)
    ((0, 4, 5, 9), (7, 3, 8))
