class TextLookup(_TextLookupMixin):
    """Handle words in a 2D array-like body of text that are not in the
    pybear `Lexicon`.

    Options include replacing, removing, splitting, or skipping the word,
    or staging it to add to the pybear :class:`Lexicon`.

    TextLookup (TL) has a dual-functionality :meth:`partial_fit` method.
    TL can operate autonomously on your data for a completely hands-free
    experience, or can be driven in a fully interactive process. The
    interactive mode is a menu-driven process that prompts the user for
    a decision about a word that is not in the `Lexicon` and lazily
    stores edits to the data to be applied later during transform.

    TL has a sister module called :class:`TextLookupRealTime` which is
    not a typical scikit-style transformer. TL is more conventional in
    that the learning that takes place for both autonomous and manual
    modes happens in :meth:`partial_fit` and :meth:`fit`, information is
    stored in 'holder' attributes, and then that information is applied
    blindly to any data that is passed to :meth:`transform`. TL does
    not mutate your data during fitting, so the changes to your data do
    not happen in 'real time'. Because of this temporal dynamic, TL is
    not able to save changes to your data in-situ. If you log a lot of
    changes to your data in `partial_fit` or `fit` and then the program
    terminates for whatever reason, you lose all your work. If you want
    to make edits to the data in real time and be able to save your
    changes in-situ then use TextLookupRealTime.

    To run TL in autonomous mode, set either `auto_delete` or
    `auto_add_to_lexicon` to True; both cannot simultaneously be True.
    `auto_add_to_lexicon` can only be True if the `update_lexicon`
    parameter is True.

    When `auto_add_to_lexicon` is True, if TL encounters a word that is
    not in the `Lexicon` it will automatically stage the word in
    the :attr:`LEXICON_ADDENDUM_` and go to the next word until all the
    words in the text are exhausted. When `auto_delete` is True, if TL
    encounters a word that is not in the `Lexicon`, it will silently add
    the word to the :attr:`DELETE_ALWAYS_` attribute and go to the next
    word, until all the words in the text are exhausted. In these cases,
    TL can never proceed into manual mode. To allow TL to go into manual
    mode, `auto_delete` and `auto_add_to_lexicon` both must be False.

    In manual mode, when TL encounters a word that is not in the
    `Lexicon`, the user will be prompted with an interactive menu for an
    action. Choices that are always presented include: 'skip always',
    'delete always', 'replace always', and 'split always'. Conditionally,
    if `update_lexicon`. is True, an 'add to lexicon' option is also
    presented. If you choose something from the 'always' group, the word
    goes into a 'holder' object for the selected action so that TL knows
    how to handle it during transform. TL does not have the ability to
    handle the same word in different ways at different times. Whatever
    instruction is selected for one occurrence of a word must be applied
    to all occurrences of the word because the storage mechanisms for
    the operation/word combinations do not track the exact locations of
    individual words.

    When you are in the manual text lookup process and are entering words
    at the prompts to replace unknown words in your text, whatever is
    entered is inserted into your text exactly as entered by you. You
    must enter the text exactly as you want it in the cleaned output. If
    normalizing the text is important to you, you must enter the text in
    the case that you want in the output, TL will not do it for you.

    The holder objects are all accessible attributes in the TL public
    API. See the Attributes section for more details. These holder
    objects can also be passed at instantiation to give TL a head-start
    on words that aren't in the `Lexicon` and helps make a manual session
    more automated. Let's say, for example, that you know that your
    text is full of some proper names that aren't in the `Lexicon`, and
    you don't want to add them permanently, and you don't want to have
    to always tell TL what to do with these words when they come up.
    You decide that you want to leave them in the text body and have
    TL ignore them. At instantiation pass a list of these strings to
    the `SKIP_ALWAYS` parameter. So you might pass ['ZEKE', 'YVONNE',
    'XAVIER',...] to `SKIP_ALWAYS`. TL will always skip these words
    without asking. The passed `SKIP_ALWAYS` becomes the starting seed
    of the :attr:`SKIP_ALWAYS_` attribute. Any other manual inputs
    during the session that say to always skip certain other words
    will be added to this list, so that at the end of the session
    the `SKIP_ALWAYS_` attribute will contain your originally passed
    words and the words added during the session.

    TL always looks for special instructions before looking to see if
    a word is in the `Lexicon`. Otherwise, if TL checked the word against
    the `Lexicon` first and the word is it`, TL would go to the next
    word automatically. Doing it in this way allows for users to give
    special instructions for words already in the `Lexicon`. Let's say
    there is a word in the `Lexicon` but you want to delete it from your
    text. You could pass it to `DELETE_ALWAYS` and TL will remove it
    regardless of what the `Lexicon` says.

    The `update_lexicon` parameter does not cause TL to directly update
    the `Lexicon`. If the user opts to stage a word for addition to the
    `Lexicon`, the word is added to the `LEXICON_ADDENDUM_` attribute.
    This is a deliberate design choice to stage the words rather than
    silently modify the `Lexicon`. This gives the user a layer of
    protection where they can review the words staged to go into the
    `Lexicon`, make any changes needed, then manually pass them to the
    `Lexicon` `add_words` method.

    TL requires (possibly ragged) 2D data formats. Accepted objects
    include python built-in lists and tuples, numpy arrays, pandas
    dataframes, and polars dataframes. Use pybear :class:`TextSplitter`
    to convert 1D text to 2D tokens. Results are always returned as a 2D
    python list of lists of strings.

    Your data should be in a highly processed state before using TL.
    This should be one of the last steps in a text wrangling workflow
    because the content of your text will be compared directly against
    the words in the `Lexicon`, and all the words in the pybear `Lexicon`
    have no non-alpha characters and are all majuscule. All junk
    characters should be removed and clear separators established. A
    pybear text wrangling workflow might look like:
    TextStripper > TextReplacer > TextSplitter > TextNormalizer >
    TextRemover > TextLookup > StopRemover > TextJoiner > TextJustifier

    Every operation in TL is case-sensitive. Remember that the formal
    pybear `Lexicon` is majuscule; use pybear :class:`TextNormalizer` to
    make all your text majuscule before using TL. Otherwise, TL will
    always flag every valid word that is not majuscule because it doesn't
    exactly match the `Lexicon`. If you alter your local copy of the
    pybear `Lexicon` with your own words of varying capitalization, TL
    honors your capitalization scheme.

    If TL encounters a word during transform that was not seen during
    fitting and it is not in the `Lexicon`, the way that it is handled
    depends on the setting of the `auto_delete` parameter. If
    `auto_delete` is True, the word is deleted from the text body. If
    False, the word is skipped. In both cases, the word is added to
    an :attr:`OOV_` (out of vocabulary) dictionary. `OOV_` is only
    available after data has been passed to `transform`. The keys are
    the out-of-vocabulary words and the values are the frequency of each
    unseen word.

    TL is a full-fledged scikit-style transformer. It has fully
    functional `get_params`, `set_params`, `partial_fit`, `fit`,
    `transform`, and `fit_transform` methods. It also has a no-op
    `score` method that allows TL to be wrapped by dask_ml wrappers,
    on the off-chance that you actually have text data in dask format.

    TL has an :attr:`n_rows_` attribute which is only available after
    data has been passed to :meth:`partial_fit` or :meth:`fit`. It is
    the total number of rows of text seen in the original data and is
    not necessarily the number of rows in the outputted data. TL also
    has a :attr:`row_support_` attribute that is a boolean vector of
    shape (n_rows, ) that indicates which rows of the original data were
    kept during the transform process (True) and which were deleted
    (False). The only way that an entry could become False is if the
    `remove_empty_rows` parameter is True and a row becomes empty when
    handling unknown words. `row_support_` is only available after
    something has been passed to `transform`, and only reflects the last
    dataset passed to transform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    update_lexicon : Optional[bool], default=False
        Whether to queue words that are not in the pybear :class:`Lexicon`
        for later addition to the `Lexicon`. This applies to both
        autonomous and interactive modes. If False, TL will never put a
        word in :attr:`LEXICON_ADDENDUM_` and will never prompt you with
        the option.
    skip_numbers : Optional[bool], default=True
        When True, TL will try to do Python float(word) on the word and,
        if it can be cast to a float, TL will skip it and go to the next
        word. If False, TL will handle it like any other word. There are
        no numbers in the formal pybear `Lexicon` so TL will always flag
        them and handle them autonomously or prompt the user for an
        action. Since they are handled like any other word, it would be
        possible to stage them for addition to your local copy of the
        `Lexicon`.
    auto_split : Optional[bool], default=True
        TL will first look if the word is in any of the holder objects
        for special instructions, then look to see if the word is in
        the `Lexicon`. If not, the next step otherwise would be auto-add
        to `Lexicon`, auto-delete, or go into manual mode. This
        functionality is a last-ditch effort to see if a word is an
        erroneous compounding of 2 words that are in the `Lexicon`. If
        `auto_split` is True, TL will iteratively split any word of 4 or
        more characters from after the second character to before the
        second to last character and see if both halves are in the
        `Lexicon`. When/if the first match is found, TL will remove the
        original word, split it, and insert in the original place the 2
        halves that were found to be in the `Lexicon`. If `auto_split`
        is False, TL will skip this process and go straight to auto-add,
        auto-delete, or manual mode.
    auto_add_to_lexicon : Optional[bool], default=False
        `update_lexicon` must be True to use this parameter. Cannot
        be True if `auto_delete` is True. When this parameter is
        True, TL operates in 'auto-mode', where the user will not be
        prompted for decisions. When TL encounters a word that is
        not in the `Lexicon`, the word will silently be staged in
        the `LEXICON_ADDENDUM_` attribute to be added to the `Lexicon`
        later.
    auto_delete : Optional[bool], default=False
        If `update_lexicon` is True, then this cannot be set to True.
        When this parameter is True, TL operates in 'auto-mode', where
        the user will not be prompted for decisions. When TL encounters
        a word that is not in the `Lexicon`, the word will be silently
        deleted from the text body.
    DELETE_ALWAYS : Optional[Union[Sequence[str], None]], default=None
        A list of words that will always be deleted by TL, even if they
        are in the `Lexicon`. In both manual and auto modes, TL will
        silently delete the word(s), no questions asked. What is passed
        here becomes the seed for the :attr:`DELETE_ALWAYS_` attribute,
        which may have more words added to it during run-time in manual
        mode. Auto-mode will never add more words to this list.
    REPLACE_ALWAYS : Optional[Union[dict[str, str], None]], default=None
        A dictionary with words expected to be in the text body as keys
        and their respective single-word replacements as values. TL
        will replace these words even if they are in the `Lexicon`.
        For both auto and manual mode, TL will not prompt the user for
        any more information, it will silently replace the word. What
        is passed here becomes the seed for the :attr:`REPLACE_ALWAYS_`
        attribute, which may have more word/replacement pairs added to
        it during run-time in manual mode. Auto-mode will never add more
        entries to this dictionary.
    SKIP_ALWAYS : Optional[Union[Sequence[str], None]], default=None
        A list of words that will always be ignored by TL, even if
        they are not in the `Lexicon`. For both auto and manual mode,
        TL will not prompt the user for any more information, it will
        silently skip the word. What is passed here becomes the seed for
        the :attr:`SKIP_ALWAYS_` attribute, which may have more words
        added to it during run-time in manual mode. Auto-mode will only
        a add entries to this list if `ignore_numbers` is True and TL
        finds a number during partial_fit / fit.
    SPLIT_ALWAYS : Optional[Union[dict[str, Sequence[str]], None]], default=None
        A dictionary with words expected to be in the text body as keys
        and their respective multi-word lists of replacements as values.
        TL will remove the original word and insert these words into
        the text body starting in its position even if the original
        word is in the `Lexicon`. For both auto and manual mode, TL
        will not prompt the user for any more information, it will
        silently split the word. What is passed here becomes the seed
        for the :attr:`SPLIT_ALWAYS_` attribute, which may have more
        word/replacement pairs added to it during run-time in manual
        mode. Auto-mode will only add entries to this dictionary if
        `auto_split` is True and TL finds a valid split for an unknown
        word.
    remove_empty_rows : Optional[bool], default=False
        Whether to remove any rows that may have been made empty
        during the lookup process. If `remove_empty_rows` is True and
        rows are deleted, the user can find supplemental information
        in :attr:`row_support_`, which indicates through booleans which
        rows were kept (True) and which rows were removed (False).
    verbose : Optional[bool], default=False
        Whether to display helpful information during the transform
        process. This applies to both auto and manual modes.
