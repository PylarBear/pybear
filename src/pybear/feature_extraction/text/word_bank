NEWSPAPER AND THEY WENT DOWN THE TRAIL TO THE SKIFF FEELING THE PEBBLED SAND UNDER THEIR FEET AND LIFTED THE SKIFF AND SLID HER INTO THE WATER GOOD LUCK OLD MAN GOOD LUCK THE OLD MAN SAID HE FITTED THE ROPE LASHINGS OF THE OARS ONTO THE PINS AND LEANING FORWARD AGAINST THE THRUST OF THE BLADES IN THE WATER HE BEGAN TO ROW OUT OF THE HARBOUR IN THE DARK THERE WERE OTHER BOATS FROM THE OTHER BEACHES GOING OUT TO SEA AND THE OLD MAN HEARD THE DIP AND PUSH OF THEIR OARS EVEN THOUGH HE COULD NOT SEE THEM NOW THE MOON WAS BELOW THE HILLS SOMETIMES SOMEONE WOULD SPEAK IN A BOAT BUT MOST OF THE BOATS WERE SILENT EXCEPT FOR THE DIP OF THE OARS THEY SPREAD APART AFTER THEY WERE OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR AND EACH ONE HEADED FOR THE PART OF THE OCEAN WHERE HE HOPED TO FIND FISH THE OLD MAN KNEW HE WAS GOING FAR OUT AND HE LEFT THE SMELL OF THE LAND BEHIND AND ROWED OUT INTO THE CLEAN EARLY MORNING SMELL OF THE OCEAN HE SAW THE PHOSPHORESCENCE OF THE GULF WEED IN THE WATER AS HE ROWED OVER
THE PART OF THE OCEAN THAT THE FISHERMEN CALLED THE GREAT WELL BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUDDEN DEEP OF SEVEN HUNDRED FATHOMS WHERE ALL SORTS OF FISH CONGREGATED BECAUSE OF THE SWIRL THE CURRENT MADE AGAINST THE STEEP WALLS OF THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN HERE THERE WERE CONCENTRATIONS OF SHRIMP AND BAIT FISH AND SOMETIMES SCHOOLS OF SQUID IN THE DEEPEST HOLES AND THESE ROSE CLOSE TO THE SURFACE AT NIGHT WHERE ALL THE WANDERING FISH FED ON THEM IN THE DARK THE OLD MAN COULD FEEL THE MORNING COMING AND AS HE ROWED HE HEARD THE TREMBLING SOUND AS FLYING FISH LEFT THE WATER AND THE HISSING THAT THEIR STIFF SET WINGS MADE AS THEY SOARED AWAY IN THE DARKNESS HE WAS VERY FOND OF FLYING FISH AS THEY WERE HIS PRINCIPAL FRIENDS ON THE OCEAN HE WAS SORRY FOR THE BIRDS ESPECIALLY THE SMALL DELICATE DARK TERNS THAT WERE ALWAYS FLYING AND LOOKING AND ALMOST NEVER FINDING AND HE THOUGHT THE BIRDS HAVE A HARDER LIFE THAN WE DO EXCEPT FOR THE ROBBER BIRDS AND THE HEAVY STRONG ONES WHY DID THEY MAKE BIRDS SO
DELICATE AND FINE AS THOSE SEA SWALLOWS WHEN THE OCEAN CAN BE SO CRUEL SHE IS KIND AND VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT SHE CAN BE SO CRUEL AND IT COMES SO SUDDENLY AND SUCH BIRDS THAT FLY DIPPING AND HUNTING WITH THEIR SMALL SAD VOICES ARE MADE TOO DELICATELY FOR THE SEA HE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THE SEA AS MAR WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE CALL HER IN SPANISH WHEN THEY LOVE HER SOMETIMES THOSE WHO LOVE HER SAY BAD THINGS OF HER BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS SAID AS THOUGH SHE WERE A WOMAN SOME OF THE YOUNGER FISHERMEN THOSE WHO USED BUOYS AS FLOATS FOR THEIR LINES AND HAD MOTORBOATS BOUGHT WHEN THE SHARK LIVERS HAD BROUGHT MUCH MONEY SPOKE OF HER AS MAR WHICH IS MASCULINE THEY SPOKE OF HER AS A CONTESTANT OR A PLACE OR EVEN AN ENEMY BUT THE OLD MAN ALWAYS THOUGHT OF HER AS FEMININE AND AS SOMETHING THAT GAVE OR WITHHELD GREAT FAVOURS AND IF SHE DID WILD OR WICKED THINGS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT HELP THEM THE MOON AFFECTS HER AS IT DOES A WOMAN HE THOUGHT HE WAS ROWING STEADILY AND IT WAS NO EFFORT FOR HIM SINCE HE
KEPT WELL WITHIN HIS SPEED AND THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN WAS FLAT EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL SWIRLS OF THE CURRENT HE WAS LETTING THE CURRENT DO A THIRD OF THE WORK AND AS IT STARTED TO BE LIGHT HE SAW HE WAS ALREADY FURTHER OUT THAN HE HAD HOPED TO BE AT THIS HOUR I WORKED THE DEEP WELLS FOR A WEEK AND DID NOTHING HE THOUGHT TODAY ILL WORK OUT WHERE THE SCHOOLS OF AND ALBACORE ARE AND MAYBE THERE WILL BE A BIG ONE WITH THEM BEFORE IT WAS REALLY LIGHT HE HAD HIS BAITS OUT AND WAS DRIFTING WITH THE CURRENT ONE BAIT WAS DOWN FORTY FATHOMS THE SECOND WAS AT AND THE THIRD AND FOURTH WERE DOWN IN THE BLUE WATER AT ONE HUNDRED AND ONE HUNDRED AND FATHOMS EACH BAIT HUNG HEAD DOWN WITH THE SHANK OF THE HOOK INSIDE THE BAIT FISH TIED AND SEWED SOLID AND ALL THE PROJECTING PART OF THE HOOK THE CURVE AND THE POINT WAS COVERED WITH FRESH SARDINES EACH SARDINE WAS HOOKED THROUGH BOTH EYES SO THAT THEY MADE A HALF GARLAND ON THE PROJECTING STEEL THERE WAS NO PART OF THE HOOK THAT A GREAT FISH COULD
FEEL WHICH WAS NOT SWEET SMELLING AND GOOD TASTING THE BOY HAD GIVEN HIM TWO FRESH SMALL TUNAS OR ALBACORES WHICH HUNG ON THE TWO DEEPEST LINES LIKE PLUMMETS AND ON THE OTHERS HE HAD A BIG BLUE RUNNER AND A YELLOW JACK THAT HAD BEEN USED BEFORE BUT THEY WERE IN GOOD CONDITION STILL AND HAD THE EXCELLENT SARDINES TO GIVE THEM SCENT AND ATTRACTIVENESS EACH LINE AS THICK AROUND AS A BIG PENCIL WAS LOOPED ONTO A GREEN SAPPED STICK SO THAT ANY PULL OR TOUCH ON THE BAIT WOULD MAKE THE STICK DIP AND EACH LINE HAD TWO FORTY FATHOM COILS WHICH COULD BE MADE FAST TO THE OTHER SPARE COILS SO THAT IF IT WERE NECESSARY A FISH COULD TAKE OUT OVER THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS OF LINE NOW THE MAN WATCHED THE DIP OF THE THREE STICKS OVER THE SIDE OF THE SKIFF AND ROWED GENTLY TO KEEP THE LINES STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN AND AT THEIR PROPER DEPTHS IT WAS QUITE LIGHT AND ANY MOMENT NOW THE SUN WOULD RISE THE SUN ROSE THINLY FROM THE SEA AND THE OLD MAN COULD SEE THE OTHER BOATS LOW ON THE WATER AND WELL IN TOWARD THE
SHORE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE CURRENT THEN THE SUN WAS BRIGHTER AND THE GLARE CAME ON THE WATER AND THEN AS IT ROSE CLEAR THE FLAT SEA SENT IT BACK AT HIS EYES SO THAT IT HURT SHARPLY AND HE ROWED WITHOUT LOOKING INTO IT HE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WATER AND WATCHED THE LINES THAT WENT STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE DARK OF THE WATER HE KEPT THEM STRAIGHTER THAN ANYONE DID SO THAT AT EACH LEVEL IN THE DARKNESS OF THE STREAM THERE WOULD BE A BAIT WAITING EXACTLY WHERE HE WISHED IT TO BE FOR ANY FISH THAT SWAM THERE OTHERS LET THEM DRIFT WITH THE CURRENT AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE AT SIXTY FATHOMS WHEN THE FISHERMEN THOUGHT THEY WERE AT A HUNDRED BUT HE THOUGHT I KEEP THEM WITH PRECISION ONLY I HAVE NO LUCK ANY MORE BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE TODAY EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY IT IS BETTER TO BE LUCKY BUT I WOULD RATHER BE EXACT THEN WHEN LUCK COMES YOU ARE READY THE SUN WAS TWO HOURS HIGHER NOW AND IT DID NOT HURT HIS EYES SO MUCH TO LOOK INTO THE EAST THERE WERE ONLY THREE BOATS IN SIGHT NOW AND THEY SHOWED VERY
LOW AND FAR INSHORE ALL MY LIFE THE EARLY SUN HAS HURT MY EYES HE THOUGHT YET THEY ARE STILL GOOD IN THE EVENING I CAN LOOK STRAIGHT INTO IT WITHOUT GETTING THE BLACKNESS IT HAS MORE FORCE IN THE EVENING TOO BUT IN THE MORNING IT IS PAINFUL JUST THEN HE SAW A MANOFWAR BIRD WITH HIS LONG BLACK WINGS CIRCLING IN THE SKY AHEAD OF HIM HE MADE A QUICK DROP SLANTING DOWN ON HIS BACKSWEPT WINGS AND THEN CIRCLED AGAIN HES GOT SOMETHING THE OLD MAN SAID ALOUD HES NOT JUST LOOKING HE ROWED SLOWLY AND STEADILY TOWARD WHERE THE BIRD WAS CIRCLING HE DID NOT HURRY AND HE KEPT HIS LINES STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN BUT HE CROWDED THE CURRENT A LITTLE SO THAT HE WAS STILL FISHING CORRECTLY THOUGH FASTER THAN HE WOULD HAVE FISHED IF HE WAS NOT TRYING TO USE THE BIRD THE BIRD WENT HIGHER IN THE AIR AND CIRCLED AGAIN HIS WINGS MOTIONLESS THEN HE DOVE SUDDENLY AND THE OLD MAN SAW FLYING FISH SPURT OUT OF THE WATER AND SAIL DESPERATELY OVER THE SURFACE DOLPHIN THE OLD MAN SAID ALOUD BIG DOLPHIN HE SHIPPED HIS OARS
AND BROUGHT A SMALL LINE FROM UNDER THE BOW IT HAD A WIRE LEADER AND A MEDIUM SIZED HOOK AND HE BAITED IT WITH ONE OF THE SARDINES HE LET IT GO OVER THE SIDE AND THEN MADE IT FAST TO A RING BOLT IN THE STERN THEN HE BAITED ANOTHER LINE AND LEFT IT COILED IN THE SHADE OF THE BOW HE WENT BACK TO ROWING AND TO WATCHING THE LONGWINGED BLACK BIRD WHO WAS WORKING NOW LOW OVER THE WATER AS HE WATCHED THE BIRD DIPPED AGAIN SLANTING HIS WINGS FOR THE DIVE AND THEN SWINGING THEM WILDLY AND INEFFECTUALLY AS HE FOLLOWED THE FLYING FISH THE OLD MAN COULD SEE THE SLIGHT BULGE IN THE WATER THAT THE BIG DOLPHIN RAISED AS THEY FOLLOWED THE ESCAPING FISH THE DOLPHIN WERE CUTTING THROUGH THE WATER BELOW THE FLIGHT OF THE FISH AND WOULD BE IN THE WATER DRIVING AT SPEED WHEN THE FISH DROPPED IT IS A BIG SCHOOL OF DOLPHIN HE THOUGHT THEY ARE WIDE SPREAD AND THE FLYING FISH HAVE LITTLE CHANCE THE BIRD HAS NO CHANCE THE FLYING FISH ARE TOO BIG FOR HIM AND THEY GO TOO FAST HE WATCHED THE FLYING FISH BURST OUT
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE INEFFECTUAL MOVEMENTS OF THE BIRD THAT SCHOOL HAS GOTTEN AWAY FROM ME HE THOUGHT THEY ARE MOVING OUT TOO FAST AND TOO FAR BUT PERHAPS I WILL PICK UP A STRAY AND PERHAPS MY BIG FISH IS AROUND THEM MY BIG FISH MUST BE SOMEWHERE THE CLOUDS OVER THE LAND NOW ROSE LIKE MOUNTAINS AND THE COAST WAS ONLY A LONG GREEN LINE WITH THE GRAY BLUE HILLS BEHIND IT THE WATER WAS A DARK BLUE NOW SO DARK THAT IT WAS ALMOST PURPLE AS HE LOOKED DOWN INTO IT HE SAW THE RED SIFTING OF THE PLANKTON IN THE DARK WATER AND THE STRANGE LIGHT THE SUN MADE NOW HE WATCHED HIS LINES TO SEE THEM GO STRAIGHT DOWN OUT OF SIGHT INTO THE WATER AND HE WAS HAPPY TO SEE SO MUCH PLANKTON BECAUSE IT MEANT FISH THE STRANGE LIGHT THE SUN MADE IN THE WATER NOW THAT THE SUN WAS HIGHER MEANT GOOD WEATHER AND SO DID THE SHAPE OF THE CLOUDS OVER THE LAND BUT THE BIRD WAS ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT NOW AND NOTHING SHOWED ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER BUT SOME PATCHES OF YELLOW SUNBLEACHED SARGASSO WEED AND THE PURPLE
FORMALIZED IRIDESCENT GELATINOUS BLADDER OF A PORTUGUESE MANOFWAR FLOATING CLOSE BESIDE THE BOAT IT TURNED ON ITS SIDE AND THEN RIGHTED ITSELF IT FLOATED CHEERFULLY AS A BUBBLE WITH ITS LONG DEADLY PURPLE FILAMENTS TRAILING A YARD AGUA THE MAN SAID YOU WHORE FROM WHERE HE SWUNG LIGHTLY AGAINST HIS OARS HE LOOKED DOWN INTO THE WATER AND SAW THE TINY FISH THAT WERE COLOURED LIKE THE TRAILING FILAMENTS AND SWAM BETWEEN THEM AND UNDER THE SMALL SHADE THE BUBBLE MADE AS IT DRIFTED THEY WERE IMMUNE TO ITS POISON BUT MEN WERE NOT AND WHEN SOME OF THE FILAMENTS WOULD CATCH ON A LINE AND REST THERE SLIMY AND PURPLE WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS WORKING A FISH HE WOULD HAVE WELTS AND SORES ON HIS ARMS AND HANDS OF THE SORT THAT POISON IVY OR POISON OAK CAN GIVE BUT THESE POISONINGS FROM THE AGUA CAME QUICKLY AND STRUCK LIKE A WHIPLASH THE IRIDESCENT BUBBLES WERE BEAUTIFUL BUT THEY WERE THE FALSEST THING IN THE SEA AND THE OLD MAN LOVED TO SEE THE BIG SEA TURTLES EATING THEM THE TURTLES SAW THEM
APPROACHED THEM FROM THE FRONT THEN SHUT THEIR EYES SO THEY WERE COMPLETELY CARAPACED AND ATE THEM FILAMENTS AND ALL THE OLD MAN LOVED TO SEE THE TURTLES EAT THEM AND HE LOVED TO WALK ON THEM ON THE BEACH AFTER A STORM AND HEAR THEM POP WHEN HE STEPPED ON THEM WITH THE HORNY SOLES OF HIS FEET HE LOVED GREEN TURTLES AND HAWKS BILLS WITH THEIR ELEGANCE AND SPEED AND THEIR GREAT VALUE AND HE HAD A FRIENDLY CONTEMPT FOR THE HUGE STUPID LOGGERHEADS YELLOW IN THEIR ARMOUR PLATING STRANGE IN THEIR LOVEMAKING AND HAPPILY EATING THE PORTUGUESE MENOFWAR WITH THEIR EYES SHUT HE HAD NO MYSTICISM ABOUT TURTLES ALTHOUGH HE HAD GONE IN TURTLE BOATS FOR MANY YEARS HE WAS SORRY FOR THEM ALL EVEN THE GREAT TRUNK BACKS THAT WERE AS LONG AS THE SKIFF AND WEIGHED A TON MOST PEOPLE ARE HEARTLESS ABOUT TURTLES BECAUSE A TURTLES HEART WILL BEAT FOR HOURS AFTER HE HAS BEEN CUT UP AND BUTCHERED BUT THE OLD MAN THOUGHT I HAVE SUCH A HEART TOO AND MY FEET AND HANDS ARE LIKE THEIRS HE ATE THE WHITE EGGS TO GIVE
HIMSELF STRENGTH HE ATE THEM ALL THROUGH MAY TO BE STRONG IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER FOR THE TRULY BIG FISH HE ALSO DRANK A CUP OF SHARK LIVER OIL EACH DAY FROM THE BIG DRUM IN THE SHACK WHERE MANY OF THE FISHERMEN KEPT THEIR GEAR IT WAS THERE FOR ALL FISHERMEN WHO WANTED IT MOST FISHERMEN HATED THE TASTE BUT IT WAS NO WORSE THAN GETTING UP AT THE HOURS THAT THEY ROSE AND IT WAS VERY GOOD AGAINST ALL COLDS AND GRIPS AND IT WAS GOOD FOR THE EYES NOW THE OLD MAN LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE BIRD WAS CIRCLING AGAIN HES FOUND FISH HE SAID ALOUD NO FLYING FISH BROKE THE SURFACE AND THERE WAS NO SCATTERING OF BAIT FISH BUT AS THE OLD MAN WATCHED A SMALL TUNA ROSE IN THE AIR TURNED AND DROPPED HEAD FIRST INTO THE WATER THE TUNA SHONE SILVER IN THE SUN AND AFTER HE HAD DROPPED BACK INTO THE WATER ANOTHER AND ANOTHER ROSE AND THEY WERE JUMPING IN ALL DIRECTIONS CHURNING THE WATER AND LEAPING IN LONG JUMPS AFTER THE BAIT THEY WERE CIRCLING IT AND DRIVING IT IF THEY DONT TRAVEL TOO FAST I WILL GET

LIKE A MALE AND HE PULLS LIKE A MALE AND HIS FIGHT HAS NO PANIC IN IT I WONDER IF HE HAS ANY PLANS OR IF HE IS JUST AS DESPERATE AS I AM HE REMEMBERED THE TIME HE HAD HOOKED ONE OF A PAIR OF MARLIN THE MALE FISH ALWAYS LET THE FEMALE FISH FEED FIRST AND THE HOOKED FISH THE FEMALE MADE A WILD PANICSTRICKEN DESPAIRING FIGHT THAT SOON EXHAUSTED HER AND ALL THE TIME THE MALE HAD STAYED WITH HER CROSSING THE LINE AND CIRCLING WITH HER ON THE SURFACE HE HAD STAYED SO CLOSE THAT THE OLD MAN WAS AFRAID HE WOULD CUT THE LINE WITH HIS TAIL WHICH WAS SHARP AS A SCYTHE AND ALMOST OF THAT SIZE AND SHAPE WHEN THE OLD MAN HAD GAFFED HER AND CLUBBED HER HOLDING THE RAPIER BILL WITH ITS SANDPAPER EDGE AND CLUBBING HER ACROSS THE TOP OF HER HEAD UNTIL HER COLOUR TURNED TO A COLOUR ALMOST LIKE THE BACKING OF MIRRORS AND THEN WITH THE BOYS AID HOISTED HER ABOARD THE MALE FISH HAD STAYED BY THE SIDE OF THE BOAT THEN WHILE THE OLD MAN WAS CLEARING THE LINES AND PREPARING THE HARPOON THE MALE FISH JUMPED
HIGH INTO THE AIR BESIDE THE BOAT TO SEE WHERE THE FEMALE WAS AND THEN WENT DOWN DEEP HIS LAVENDER WINGS THAT WERE HIS THAT WAS THE SADDEST THING I EVER SAW WITH THEM THE OLD MAN THOUGHT THE BOY WAS SAD TOO AND WE BEGGED HER PARDON AND BUTCHERED HER PROMPTLY I WISH THE BOY WAS HERE HE SAID ALOUD AND SETTLED HIMSELF AGAINST THE ROUNDED PLANKS OF THE BOW AND FELT THE STRENGTH OF THE GREAT FISH THROUGH THE LINE HE HELD ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS MOVING STEADILY TOWARD WHATEVER HE HAD CHOSEN WHEN ONCE THROUGH MY TREACHERY IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO HIM TO MAKE A CHOICE THE OLD MAN THOUGHT HIS CHOICE HAD BEEN TO STAY IN THE DEEP DARK WATER FAR OUT BEYOND ALL SNARES AND TRAPS AND TREACHERIES MY CHOICE WAS TO GO THERE TO FIND HIM BEYOND ALL PEOPLE BEYOND ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD NOW WE ARE JOINED TOGETHER AND HAVE BEEN SINCE NOON AND NO ONE TO HELP EITHER ONE OF US PERHAPS I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FISHERMAN HE THOUGHT BUT THAT WAS THE THING THAT I WAS BORN FOR I MUST SURELY REMEMBER TO EAT THE TUNA
AFTER IT GETS LIGHT SOME TIME BEFORE DAYLIGHT SOMETHING TOOK ONE OF THE BAITS THAT WERE BEHIND HIM HE HEARD THE STICK BREAK AND THE LINE BEGIN TO RUSH OUT OVER THE GUNWALE OF THE SKIFF IN THE DARKNESS HE LOOSENED HIS SHEATH KNIFE AND TAKING ALL THE STRAIN OF THE FISH ON HIS LEFT SHOULDER HE LEANED BACK AND CUT THE LINE AGAINST THE WOOD OF THE GUNWALE THEN HE CUT THE OTHER LINE CLOSEST TO HIM AND IN THE DARK MADE THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE RESERVE COILS FAST HE WORKED SKILLFULLY WITH THE ONE HAND AND PUT HIS FOOT ON THE COILS TO HOLD THEM AS HE DREW HIS KNOTS TIGHT NOW HE HAD SIX RESERVE COILS OF LINE THERE WERE TWO FROM EACH BAIT HE HAD SEVERED AND THE TWO FROM THE BAIT THE FISH HAD TAKEN AND THEY WERE ALL CONNECTED AFTER IT IS LIGHT HE THOUGHT I WILL WORK BACK TO THE FORTY FATHOM BAIT AND CUT IT AWAY TOO AND LINK UP THE RESERVE COILS I WILL HAVE LOST TWO HUNDRED FATHOMS OF GOOD CATAMARAN AND THE HOOKS AND LEADERS THAT CAN BE REPLACED BUT WHO REPLACES THIS FISH IF I HOOK SOME FISH AND IT
CUTS HIM OFF I DONT KNOW WHAT THAT FISH WAS THAT TOOK THE BAIT JUST NOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN A MARLIN OR A BROADBILL OR A SHARK I NEVER FELT HIM I HAD TO GET RID OF HIM TOO FAST ALOUD HE SAID I WISH I HAD THE BOY BUT YOU HAVENT GOT THE BOY HE THOUGHT YOU HAVE ONLY YOURSELF AND YOU HAD BETTER WORK BACK TO THE LAST LINE NOW IN THE DARK OR NOT IN THE DARK AND CUT IT AWAY AND HOOK UP THE TWO RESERVE COILS SO HE DID IT IT WAS DIFFICULT IN THE DARK AND ONCE THE FISH MADE A SURGE THAT PULLED HIM DOWN ON HIS FACE AND MADE A CUT BELOW HIS EYE THE BLOOD RAN DOWN HIS CHEEK A LITTLE WAY BUT IT COAGULATED AND DRIED BEFORE IT REACHED HIS CHIN AND HE WORKED HIS WAY BACK TO THE BOW AND RESTED AGAINST THE WOOD HE ADJUSTED THE SACK AND CAREFULLY WORKED THE LINE SO THAT IT CAME ACROSS A NEW PART OF HIS SHOULDERS AND HOLDING IT ANCHORED WITH HIS SHOULDERS HE CAREFULLY FELT THE PULL OF THE FISH AND THEN FELT WITH HIS HAND THE PROGRESS OF THE SKIFF THROUGH THE WATER I WONDER WHAT HE MADE THAT LURCH FOR HE
THOUGHT THE WIRE MUST HAVE SLIPPED ON THE GREAT HILL OF HIS BACK CERTAINLY HIS BACK CANNOT FEEL AS BADLY AS MINE DOES BUT HE CANNOT PULL THIS SKIFF FOREVER NO MATTER HOW GREAT HE IS NOW EVERYTHING IS CLEARED AWAY THAT MIGHT MAKE TROUBLE AND I HAVE A BIG RESERVE OF LINE ALL THAT A MAN CAN ASK FISH HE SAID SOFTLY ALOUD ILL STAY WITH YOU UNTIL I AM DEAD HELL STAY WITH ME TOO I SUPPOSE THE OLD MAN THOUGHT AND HE WAITED FOR IT TO BE LIGHT IT WAS COLD NOW IN THE TIME BEFORE DAYLIGHT AND HE PUSHED AGAINST THE WOOD TO BE WARM I CAN DO IT AS LONG AS HE CAN HE THOUGHT AND IN THE FIRST LIGHT THE LINE EXTENDED OUT AND DOWN INTO THE WATER THE BOAT MOVED STEADILY AND WHEN THE FIRST EDGE OF THE SUN ROSE IT WAS ON THE OLD MANS RIGHT SHOULDER HES HEADED NORTH THE OLD MAN SAID THE CURRENT WILL HAVE SET US FAR TO THE EASTWARD HE THOUGHT I WISH HE WOULD TURN WITH THE CURRENT THAT WOULD SHOW THAT HE WAS TIRING WHEN THE SUN HAD RISEN FURTHER THE OLD MAN REALIZED THAT THE FISH WAS NOT TIRING THERE WAS ONLY
ONE FAVORABLE SIGN THE SLANT OF THE LINE SHOWED HE WAS SWIMMING AT A LESSER DEPTH THAT DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT HE WOULD JUMP BUT HE MIGHT GOD LET HIM JUMP THE OLD MAN SAID I HAVE ENOUGH LINE TO HANDLE HIM MAYBE IF I CAN INCREASE THE TENSION JUST A LITTLE IT WILL HURT HIM AND HE WILL JUMP HE THOUGHT NOW THAT IT IS DAYLIGHT LET HIM JUMP SO THAT HELL FILL THE SACKS ALONG HIS BACKBONE WITH AIR AND THEN HE CANNOT GO DEEP TO DIE HE TRIED TO INCREASE THE TENSION BUT THE LINE HAD BEEN TAUT UP TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE BREAKING POINT SINCE HE HAD HOOKED THE FISH AND HE FELT THE HARSHNESS AS HE LEANED BACK TO PULL AND KNEW HE COULD PUT NO MORE STRAIN ON IT I MUST NOT JERK IT EVER HE THOUGHT EACH JERK WIDENS THE CUT THE HOOK MAKES AND THEN WHEN HE DOES JUMP HE MIGHT THROW IT ANYWAY I FEEL BETTER WITH THE SUN AND FOR ONCE I DO NOT HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT THERE WAS YELLOW WEED ON THE LINE BUT THE OLD MAN KNEW THAT ONLY MADE AN ADDED DRAG AND HE WAS PLEASED IT WAS THE YELLOW GULF WEED THAT HAD MADE
SO MUCH PHOSPHORESCENCE IN THE NIGHT FISH HE SAID I LOVE YOU AND RESPECT YOU VERY MUCH BUT I WILL KILL YOU DEAD BEFORE THIS DAY ENDS LET US HOPE SO HE THOUGHT A SMALL BIRD CAME TOWARD THE SKIFF FROM THE NORTH HE WAS A WARBLER AND FLYING VERY LOW OVER THE WATER THE OLD MAN COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY TIRED THE BIRD MADE THE STERN OF THE BOAT AND RESTED THERE THEN HE FLEW AROUND THE OLD MANS HEAD AND RESTED ON THE LINE WHERE HE WAS MORE COMFORTABLE HOW OLD ARE YOU THE OLD MAN ASKED THE BIRD IS THIS YOUR FIRST TRIP THE BIRD LOOKED AT HIM WHEN HE SPOKE HE WAS TOO TIRED EVEN TO EXAMINE THE LINE AND HE TEETERED ON IT AS HIS DELICATE FEET GRIPPED IT FAST ITS STEADY THE OLD MAN TOLD HIM ITS TOO STEADY YOU SHOULDNT BE THAT TIRED AFTER A WINDLESS NIGHT WHAT ARE BIRDS COMING TO THE HAWKS HE THOUGHT THAT COME OUT TO SEA TO MEET THEM BUT HE SAID NOTHING OF THIS TO THE BIRD WHO COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM ANYWAY AND WHO WOULD LEARN ABOUT THE HAWKS SOON ENOUGH TAKE A GOOD REST SMALL BIRD HE SAID THEN GO
IN AND TAKE YOUR CHANCE LIKE ANY MAN OR BIRD OR FISH IT ENCOURAGED HIM TO TALK BECAUSE HIS BACK HAD STIFFENED IN THE NIGHT AND IT HURT TRULY NOW STAY AT MY HOUSE IF YOU LIKE BIRD HE SAID I AM SORRY I CANNOT HOIST THE SAIL AND TAKE YOU IN WITH THE SMALL BREEZE THAT IS RISING BUT I AM WITH A FRIEND JUST THEN THE FISH GAVE A SUDDEN LURCH THAT PULLED THE OLD MAN DOWN ONTO THE BOW AND WOULD HAVE PULLED HIM OVERBOARD IF HE HAD NOT BRACED HIMSELF AND GIVEN SOME LINE THE BIRD HAD FLOWN UP WHEN THE LINE JERKED AND THE OLD MAN HAD NOT EVEN SEEN HIM GO HE FELT THE LINE CAREFULLY WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AND NOTICED HIS HAND WAS BLEEDING SOMETHING HURT HIM THEN HE SAID ALOUD AND PULLED BACK ON THE LINE TO SEE IF HE COULD TURN THE FISH BUT WHEN HE WAS TOUCHING THE BREAKING POINT HE HELD STEADY AND SETTLED BACK AGAINST THE STRAIN OF THE LINE YOURE FEELING IT NOW FISH HE SAID AND SO GOD KNOWS AM I HE LOOKED AROUND FOR THE BIRD NOW BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE LIKED HIM FOR COMPANY THE BIRD WAS GONE YOU DID NOT

KNEW HE WOULD NEED HIS HANDS BEFORE THIS WAS OVER AND HE DID NOT LIKE TO BE CUT BEFORE IT STARTED NOW HE SAID WHEN HIS HAND HAD DRIED I MUST EAT THE SMALL TUNA I CAN REACH HIM WITH THE GAFF AND EAT HIM HERE IN COMFORT HE KNELT DOWN AND FOUND THE TUNA UNDER THE STERN WITH THE GAFF AND DREW IT TOWARD HIM KEEPING IT CLEAR OF THE COILED LINES HOLDING THE LINE WITH HIS LEFT SHOULDER AGAIN AND BRACING ON HIS LEFT HAND AND ARM HE TOOK THE TUNA OFF THE GAFF HOOK AND PUT THE GAFF BACK IN PLACE HE PUT ONE KNEE ON THE FISH AND CUT STRIPS OF DARK RED MEAT LONGITUDINALLY FROM THE BACK OF THE HEAD TO THE TAIL THEY WERE WEDGE SHAPED STRIPS AND HE CUT THEM FROM NEXT TO THE BACK BONE DOWN TO THE EDGE OF THE BELLY WHEN HE HAD CUT SIX STRIPS HE SPREAD THEM OUT ON THE WOOD OF THE BOW WIPED HIS KNIFE ON HIS TROUSERS AND LIFTED THE CARCASS OF THE BY THE TAIL AND DROPPED IT OVERBOARD I DONT THINK I CAN EAT AN ENTIRE ONE HE SAID AND DREW HIS KNIFE ACROSS ONE OF THE STRIPS HE COULD FEEL THE STEADY HARD PULL OF
THE LINE AND HIS LEFT HAND WAS CRAMPED IT DREW UP TIGHT ON THE HEAVY CORD AND HE LOOKED AT IT IN DISGUST WHAT KIND OF A HAND IS THAT HE SAID CRAMP THEN IF YOU WANT MAKE YOURSELF INTO A CLAW IT WILL DO YOU NO GOOD COME ON HE THOUGHT AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE DARK WATER AT THE SLANT OF THE LINE EAT IT NOW AND IT WILL STRENGTHEN THE HAND IT IS NOT THE HANDS FAULT AND YOU HAVE BEEN MANY HOURS WITH THE FISH BUT YOU CAN STAY WITH HIM FOREVER EAT THE NOW HE PICKED UP A PIECE AND PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH AND CHEWED IT SLOWLY IT WAS NOT UNPLEASANT CHEW IT WELL HE THOUGHT AND GET ALL THE JUICES IT WOULD NOT BE BAD TO EAT WITH A LITTLE LIME OR WITH LEMON OR WITH SALT HOW DO YOU FEEL HAND HE ASKED THE CRAMPED HAND THAT WAS ALMOST AS STIFF AS RIGOR ILL EAT SOME MORE FOR YOU HE ATE THE OTHER PART OF THE PIECE THAT HE HAD CUT IN TWO HE CHEWED IT CAREFULLY AND THEN SPAT OUT THE SKIN HOW DOES IT GO HAND OR IS IT TOO EARLY TO KNOW HE TOOK ANOTHER FULL PIECE AND CHEWED IT IT IS A STRONG FULLBLOODED FISH HE

DO BUT HE SEEMS CALM HE THOUGHT AND FOLLOWING HIS PLAN BUT WHAT IS HIS PLAN HE THOUGHT AND WHAT IS MINE MINE I MUST IMPROVISE TO HIS BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT SIZE IF HE WILL JUMP I CAN KILL HIM BUT HE STAYS DOWN FOREVER THEN I WILL STAY DOWN WITH HIM FOREVER HE RUBBED THE CRAMPED HAND AGAINST HIS TROUSERS AND TRIED TO GENTLE THE FINGERS BUT IT WOULD NOT OPEN MAYBE IT WILL OPEN WITH THE SUN HE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WILL OPEN WHEN THE STRONG RAW TUNA IS DIGESTED IF I HAVE TO HAVE IT I WILL OPEN IT COST WHATEVER IT COSTS BUT I DO NOT WANT TO OPEN IT NOW BY FORCE LET IT OPEN BY ITSELF AND COME BACK OF ITS OWN ACCORD AFTER ALL I ABUSED IT MUCH IN THE NIGHT WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO FREE AND UNITE THE VARIOUS LINES HE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA AND KNEW HOW ALONE HE WAS NOW BUT HE COULD SEE THE PRISMS IN THE DEEP DARK WATER AND THE LINE STRETCHING AHEAD AND THE STRANGE UNDULATION OF THE CALM THE CLOUDS WERE BUILDING UP NOW FOR THE TRADE WIND AND HE LOOKED AHEAD AND SAW A FLIGHT OF WILD DUCKS ETCHING
THEMSELVES AGAINST THE SKY OVER THE WATER THEN BLURRING THEN ETCHING AGAIN AND HE KNEW NO MAN WAS EVER ALONE ON THE SEA HE THOUGHT OF HOW SOME MEN FEARED BEING OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND IN A SMALL BOAT AND KNEW THEY WERE RIGHT IN THE MONTHS OF SUDDEN BAD WEATHER BUT NOW THEY WERE IN HURRICANE MONTHS AND WHEN THERE ARE NO HURRICANES THE WEATHER OF HURRICANE MONTHS IS THE BEST OF ALL THE YEAR IF THERE IS A HURRICANE YOU ALWAYS SEE THE SIGNS OF IT IN THE SKY FOR DAYS AHEAD IF YOU ARE AT SEA THEY DO NOT SEE IT ASHORE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR HE THOUGHT THE LAND MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE TOO IN THE SHAPE OF THE CLOUDS BUT WE HAVE NO HURRICANE COMING NOW HE LOOKED AT THE SKY AND SAW THE WHITE CUMULUS BUILT LIKE FRIENDLY PILES OF ICE CREAM AND HIGH ABOVE WERE THE THIN FEATHERS OF THE CIRRUS AGAINST THE HIGH SEPTEMBER SKY LIGHT HE SAID BETTER WEATHER FOR ME THAN FOR YOU FISH HIS LEFT HAND WAS STILL CRAMPED BUT HE WAS UNKNOTTING IT SLOWLY I HATE A CRAMP HE THOUGHT IT IS A TREACHERY OF
ONES OWN BODY IT IS HUMILIATING BEFORE OTHERS TO HAVE A DIARRHEA FROM POISONING OR TO VOMIT FROM IT BUT A CRAMP HE THOUGHT OF IT AS A HUMILIATES ONESELF ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE IS ALONE IF THE BOY WERE HERE HE COULD RUB IT FOR ME AND LOOSEN IT DOWN FROM THE FOREARM HE THOUGHT BUT IT WILL LOOSEN UP THEN WITH HIS RIGHT HAND HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE PULL OF THE LINE BEFORE HE SAW THE SLANT CHANGE IN THE WATER THEN AS HE LEANED AGAINST THE LINE AND SLAPPED HIS LEFT HAND HARD AND FAST AGAINST HIS THIGH HE SAW THE LINE SLANTING SLOWLY UPWARD HES COMING UP HE SAID COME ON HAND PLEASE COME ON THE LINE ROSE SLOWLY AND STEADILY AND THEN THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN BULGED AHEAD OF THE BOAT AND THE FISH CAME OUT HE CAME OUT UNENDINGLY AND WATER POURED FROM HIS SIDES HE WAS BRIGHT IN THE SUN AND HIS HEAD AND BACK WERE DARK PURPLE AND IN THE SUN THE STRIPES ON HIS SIDES SHOWED WIDE AND A LIGHT LAVENDER HIS SWORD WAS AS LONG AS A BAT AND TAPERED LIKE A RAPIER AND HE ROSE HIS FULL LENGTH FROM THE WATER

CROSS TREES OF THE MASTHEAD AND EVEN AT THAT HEIGHT I SAW MUCH THE DOLPHIN LOOK GREENER FROM THERE AND YOU CAN SEE THEIR STRIPES AND THEIR PURPLE SPOTS AND YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE SCHOOL AS THEY SWIM WHY IS IT THAT ALL THE FASTMOVING FISH OF THE DARK CURRENT HAVE PURPLE BACKS AND USUALLY PURPLE STRIPES OR SPOTS THE DOLPHIN LOOKS GREEN OF COURSE BECAUSE HE IS REALLY GOLDEN BUT WHEN HE COMES TO FEED TRULY HUNGRY PURPLE STRIPES SHOW ON HIS SIDES AS ON A MARLIN CAN IT BE ANGER OR THE GREATER SPEED HE MAKES THAT BRINGS THEM OUT JUST BEFORE IT WAS DARK AS THEY PASSED A GREAT ISLAND OF SARGASSO WEED THAT HEAVED AND SWUNG IN THE LIGHT SEA AS THOUGH THE OCEAN WERE MAKING LOVE WITH SOMETHING UNDER A YELLOW BLANKET HIS SMALL LINE WAS TAKEN BY A DOLPHIN HE SAW IT FIRST WHEN IT JUMPED IN THE AIR TRUE GOLD IN THE LAST OF THE SUN AND BENDING AND FLAPPING WILDLY IN THE AIR IT JUMPED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THE ACROBATICS OF ITS FEAR AND HE WORKED HIS WAY BACK TO THE STERN AND CROUCHING AND HOLDING THE BIG
LINE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND AND ARM HE PULLED THE DOLPHIN IN WITH HIS LEFT HAND STEPPING ON THE GAINED LINE EACH TIME WITH HIS BARE LEFT FOOT WHEN THE FISH WAS AT THE STERN PLUNGING AND CUTTING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN DESPERATION THE OLD MAN LEANED OVER THE STERN AND LIFTED THE BURNISHED GOLD FISH WITH ITS PURPLE SPOTS OVER THE STERN ITS JAWS WERE WORKING CONVULSIVELY IN QUICK BITES AGAINST THE HOOK AND IT POUNDED THE BOTTOM OF THE SKIFF WITH ITS LONG FLAT BODY ITS TAIL AND ITS HEAD UNTIL HE CLUBBED IT ACROSS THE SHIN THE OLD MAN UNHOOKED THE FISH REBAITED THE LINE WITH ANOTHER SARDINE AND TOSSED IT OVER THEN HE WORKED HIS WAY SLOWLY BACK TO THE BOW HE WASHED HIS LEFT HAND AND WIPED IT ON HIS TROUSERS THEN HE SHIFTED THE HEAVY LINE FROM HIS RIGHT HAND TO HIS LEFT AND WASHED HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE SEA WHILE HE WATCHED THE SUN GO INTO THE OCEAN AND THE SLANT OF THE BIG CORD HE HASNT CHANGED AT ALL HE SAID BUT WATCHING THE MOVEMENT OF THE WATER AGAINST HIS HAND HE NOTED THAT IT WAS PERCEPTIBLY
SLOWER ILL LASH THE TWO OARS TOGETHER ACROSS THE STERN AND THAT WILL SLOW HIM IN THE NIGHT HE SAID HES GOOD FOR THE NIGHT AND SO AM I IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GUT THE DOLPHIN A LITTLE LATER TO SAVE THE BLOOD IN THE MEAT HE THOUGHT I CAN DO THAT A LITTLE LATER AND LASH THE OARS TO MAKE A DRAG AT THE SAME TIME I HAD BETTER KEEP THE FISH QUIET NOW AND NOT DISTURB HIM TOO MUCH AT SUNSET THE SETTING OF THE SUN IS A DIFFICULT TIME FOR ALL FISH HE LET HIS HAND DRY IN THE AIR THEN GRASPED THE LINE WITH IT AND EASED HIMSELF AS MUCH AS HE COULD AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE PULLED FORWARD AGAINST THE WOOD SO THAT THE BOAT TOOK THE STRAIN AS MUCH OR MORE THAN HE DID IM LEARNING HOW TO DO IT HE THOUGHT THIS PART OF IT ANYWAY THEN TOO REMEMBER HE HASNT EATEN SINCE HE TOOK THE BAIT AND HE IS HUGE AND NEEDS MUCH FOOD I HAVE EATEN THE WHOLE TOMORROW I WILL EAT THE DOLPHIN HE CALLED IT PERHAPS I SHOULD EAT SOME OF IT WHEN I CLEAN IT IT WILL BE HARDER TO EAT THAN THE BUT THEN NOTHING IS EASY HOW DO YOU FEEL
FISH HE ASKED ALOUD I FEEL GOOD AND MY LEFT HAND IS BETTER AND I HAVE FOOD FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY PULL THE BOAT FISH HE DID NOT TRULY FEEL GOOD BECAUSE THE PAIN FROM THE CORD ACROSS HIS BACK HAD ALMOST PASSED PAIN AND GONE INTO A DULLNESS THAT HE MISTRUSTED BUT I HAVE HAD WORSE THINGS THAN THAT HE THOUGHT MY HAND IS ONLY CUT A LITTLE AND THE CRAMP IS GONE FROM THE OTHER MY LEGS ARE ALL RIGHT ALSO NOW I HAVE GAINED ON HIM IN THE QUESTION OF SUSTENANCE IT WAS DARK NOW AS IT BECOMES DARK QUICKLY AFTER THE SUN SETS IN SEPTEMBER HE LAY AGAINST THE WORN WOOD OF THE BOW AND RESTED ALL THAT HE COULD THE FIRST STARS WERE OUT HE DID NOT KNOW THE NAME OF BUT HE SAW IT AND KNEW SOON THEY WOULD ALL BE OUT AND HE WOULD HAVE ALL HIS DISTANT FRIENDS THE FISH IS MY FRIEND TOO HE SAID ALOUD I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF SUCH A FISH BUT I MUST KILL HIM I AM GLAD WE DO NOT HAVE TO TRY TO KILL THE STARS IMAGINE IF EACH DAY A MAN MUST TRY TO KILL THE MOON HE THOUGHT THE MOON RUNS AWAY BUT IMAGINE IF A MAN
EACH DAY SHOULD HAVE TO TRY TO KILL THE SUN WE WERE BORN LUCKY HE THOUGHT THEN HE WAS SORRY FOR THE GREAT FISH THAT HAD NOTHING TO EAT AND HIS DETERMINATION TO KILL HIM NEVER RELAXED IN HIS SORROW FOR HIM HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL HE FEED HE THOUGHT BUT ARE THEY WORTHY TO EAT HIM NO OF COURSE NOT THERE IS NO ONE WORTHY OF EATING HIM FROM THE MANNER OF HIS BEHAVIOUR AND HIS GREAT DIGNITY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS HE THOUGHT BUT IT IS GOOD THAT WE DO NOT HAVE TO TRY TO KILL THE SUN OR THE MOON OR THE STARS IT IS ENOUGH TO LIVE ON THE SEA AND KILL OUR TRUE BROTHERS NOW HE THOUGHT I MUST THINK ABOUT THE DRAG IT HAS ITS PERILS AND ITS MERITS I MAY LOSE SO MUCH LINE THAT I WILL LOSE HIM IF HE MAKES HIS EFFORT AND THE DRAG MADE BY THE OARS IS IN PLACE AND THE BOAT LOSES ALL HER LIGHTNESS HER LIGHTNESS PROLONGS BOTH OUR SUFFERING BUT IT IS MY SAFETY SINCE HE HAS GREAT SPEED THAT HE HAS NEVER YET EMPLOYED NO MATTER WHAT PASSES I MUST GUT THE DOLPHIN SO HE DOES NOT SPOIL AND EAT SOME OF HIM TO
BE STRONG NOW I WILL REST AN HOUR MORE AND FEEL THAT HE IS SOLID AND STEADY BEFORE I MOVE BACK TO THE STERN TO DO THE WORK AND MAKE THE DECISION IN THE MEANTIME I CAN SEE HOW HE ACTS AND IF HE SHOWS ANY CHANGES THE OARS ARE A GOOD TRICK BUT IT HAS REACHED THE TIME TO PLAY FOR SAFETY HE IS MUCH FISH STILL AND I SAW THAT THE HOOK WAS IN THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH AND HE HAS KEPT HIS MOUTH TIGHT SHUT THE PUNISHMENT OF THE HOOK IS NOTHING THE PUNISHMENT OF HUNGER AND THAT HE IS AGAINST SOMETHING THAT HE DOES NOT COMPREHEND IS EVERYTHING REST NOW OLD MAN AND LET HIM WORK UNTIL YOUR NEXT DUTY COMES HE RESTED FOR WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE TWO HOURS THE MOON DID NOT RISE NOW UNTIL LATE AND HE HAD NO WAY OF JUDGING THE TIME NOR WAS HE REALLY RESTING EXCEPT COMPARATIVELY HE WAS STILL BEARING THE PULL OF THE FISH ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS BUT HE PLACED HIS LEFT HAND ON THE GUNWALE OF THE BOW AND CONFIDED MORE AND MORE OF THE RESISTANCE TO THE FISH TO THE SKIFF ITSELF HOW SIMPLE IT WOULD BE IF I COULD MAKE
THE LINE FAST HE THOUGHT BUT WITH ONE SMALL LURCH HE COULD BREAK IT I MUST CUSHION THE PULL OF THE LINE WITH MY BODY AND AT ALL TIMES BE READY TO GIVE LINE WITH BOTH HANDS BUT YOU HAVE NOT SLEPT YET OLD MAN HE SAID ALOUD IT IS HALF A DAY AND A NIGHT AND NOW ANOTHER DAY AND YOU HAVE NOT SLEPT YOU MUST DEVISE A WAY SO THAT YOU SLEEP A LITTLE IF HE IS QUIET AND STEADY IF YOU DO NOT SLEEP YOU MIGHT BECOME UNCLEAR IN THE HEAD IM CLEAR ENOUGH IN THE HEAD HE THOUGHT TOO CLEAR I AM AS CLEAR AS THE STARS THAT ARE MY BROTHERS STILL I MUST SLEEP THEY SLEEP AND THE MOON AND THE SUN SLEEP AND EVEN THE OCEAN SLEEPS SOMETIMES ON CERTAIN DAYS WHEN THERE IS NO CURRENT AND A FLAT CALM BUT REMEMBER TO SLEEP HE THOUGHT MAKE YOURSELF DO IT AND DEVISE SOME SIMPLE AND SURE WAY ABOUT THE LINES NOW GO BACK AND PREPARE THE DOLPHIN IT IS TOO DANGEROUS TO RIG THE OARS AS A DRAG IF YOU MUST SLEEP I COULD GO WITHOUT SLEEPING HE TOLD HIMSELF BUT IT WOULD BE TOO DANGEROUS HE STARTED TO WORK HIS WAY BACK TO THE STERN
ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES BEING CAREFUL NOT TO JERK AGAINST THE FISH HE MAY BE HALF ASLEEP HIMSELF HE THOUGHT BUT I DO NOT WANT HIM TO REST HE MUST PULL UNTIL HE DIES BACK IN THE STERN HE TURNED SO THAT HIS LEFT HAND HELD THE STRAIN OF THE LINE ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS AND DREW HIS KNIFE FROM ITS SHEATH WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE STARS WERE BRIGHT NOW AND HE SAW THE DOLPHIN CLEARLY AND HE PUSHED THE BLADE OF HIS KNIFE INTO HIS HEAD AND DREW HIM OUT FROM UNDER THE STERN HE PUT ONE OF HIS FEET ON THE FISH AND SLIT HIM QUICKLY FROM THE VENT UP TO THE TIP OF HIS LOWER JAW THEN HE PUT HIS KNIFE DOWN AND GUTTED HIM WITH HIS RIGHT HAND SCOOPING HIM CLEAN AND PULLING THE GILLS CLEAR HE FELT THE MAW HEAVY AND SLIPPERY IN HIS HANDS AND HE SLIT IT OPEN THERE WERE TWO FLYING FISH INSIDE THEY WERE FRESH AND HARD AND HE LAID THEM SIDE BY SIDE AND DROPPED THE GUTS AND THE GILLS OVER THE STERN THEY SANK LEAVING A TRAIL OF PHOSPHORESCENCE IN THE WATER THE DOLPHIN WAS COLD AND A LEPROUS GRAY WHITE NOW IN THE
STARLIGHT AND THE OLD MAN SKINNED ONE SIDE OF HIM WHILE HE HELD HIS RIGHT FOOT ON THE FISHES HEAD THEN HE TURNED HIM OVER AND SKINNED THE OTHER SIDE AND CUT HE SLID THE CARCASS OVERBOARD AND LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY SWIRL IN THE WATER BUT THERE WAS ONLY THE LIGHT OF ITS SLOW DESCENT HE TURNED THEN AND PLACED THE TWO FLYING FISH INSIDE THE TWO FILLETS OF FISH AND PUTTING HIS KNIFE BACK IN ITS SHEATH HE WORKED HIS WAY SLOWLY BACK TO THE BOW HIS BACK WAS BENT WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE LINE ACROSS IT AND HE CARRIED THE FISH IN HIS RIGHT HAND BACK IN THE BOW HE LAID THE TWO FILLETS OF FISH OUT ON THE WOOD WITH THE FLYING FISH BESIDE THEM AFTER THAT HE SETTLED THE LINE ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS IN A NEW PLACE AND HELD IT AGAIN WITH HIS LEFT HAND RESTING ON THE GUNWALE THEN HE LEANED OVER THE SIDE AND WASHED THE FLYING FISH IN THE WATER NOTING THE SPEED OF THE WATER AGAINST HIS HAND HIS HAND WAS PHOSPHORESCENT FROM SKINNING THE FISH AND HE WATCHED THE FLOW OF THE WATER AGAINST IT THE FLOW WAS
LESS STRONG AND AS HE RUBBED THE SIDE OF HIS HAND AGAINST THE PLANKING OF THE SKIFF PARTICLES OF PHOSPHORUS FLOATED OFF AND DRIFTED SLOWLY ASTERN HE IS TIRING OR HE IS RESTING THE OLD MAN SAID NOW LET ME GET THROUGH THE EATING OF THIS DOLPHIN AND GET SOME REST AND A LITTLE SLEEP UNDER THE STARS AND WITH THE NIGHT COLDER ALL THE TIME HE ATE HALF OF ONE OF THE DOLPHIN FILLETS AND ONE OF THE FLYING FISH GUTTED AND WITH ITS HEAD CUT OFF WHAT AN EXCELLENT FISH DOLPHIN IS TO EAT COOKED HE SAID AND WHAT A MISERABLE FISH RAW I WILL NEVER GO IN A BOAT AGAIN WITHOUT SALT OR LIMES IF I HAD BRAINS I WOULD HAVE SPLASHED WATER ON THE BOW ALL DAY AND DRYING IT WOULD HAVE MADE SALT HE THOUGHT BUT THEN I DID NOT HOOK THE DOLPHIN UNTIL ALMOST SUNSET STILL IT WAS A LACK OF PREPARATION BUT I HAVE CHEWED IT ALL WELL AND I AM NOT NAUSEATED THE SKY WAS CLOUDING OVER TO THE EAST AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE STARS HE KNEW WERE GONE IT LOOKED NOW AS THOUGH HE WERE MOVING INTO A GREAT CANYON OF CLOUDS AND THE WIND
HAD DROPPED THERE WILL BE BAD WEATHER IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE SAID BUT NOT TONIGHT AND NOT TOMORROW RIG NOW TO GET SOME SLEEP OLD MAN WHILE THE FISH IS CALM AND STEADY HE HELD THE LINE TIGHT IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND THEN PUSHED HIS THIGH AGAINST HIS RIGHT HAND AS HE LEANED ALL HIS WEIGHT AGAINST THE WOOD OF THE BOW THEN HE PASSED THE LINE A LITTLE LOWER ON HIS SHOULDERS AND BRACED HIS LEFT HAND ON IT MY RIGHT HAND CAN HOLD IT AS LONG AS IT IS BRACED HE THOUGHT IF IT RELAXES IN SLEEP MY LEFT HAND WILL WAKE ME AS THE LINE GOES OUT IT IS HARD ON THE RIGHT HAND BUT HE IS USED TO PUNISHMENT EVEN IF I SLEEP TWENTY MINUTES OR A HALF AN HOUR IT IS GOOD HE LAY FORWARD CRAMPING HIMSELF AGAINST THE LINE WITH ALL OF HIS BODY PUTTING ALL HIS WEIGHT ONTO HIS RIGHT HAND AND HE WAS ASLEEP HE DID NOT DREAM OF THE LIONS BUT INSTEAD OF A VAST SCHOOL OF PORPOISES THAT STRETCHED FOR EIGHT OR TEN MILES AND IT WAS IN THE TIME OF THEIR MATING AND THEY WOULD LEAP HIGH INTO THE AIR AND RETURN INTO THE SAME HOLE
THEY HAD MADE IN THE WATER WHEN THEY LEAPED THEN HE DREAMED THAT HE WAS IN THE VILLAGE ON HIS BED AND THERE WAS A NORTHERN AND HE WAS VERY COLD AND HIS RIGHT ARM WAS ASLEEP BECAUSE HIS HEAD HAD RESTED ON IT INSTEAD OF A PILLOW AFTER THAT HE BEGAN TO DREAM OF THE LONG YELLOW BEACH AND HE SAW THE FIRST OF THE LIONS COME DOWN ONTO IT IN THE EARLY DARK AND THEN THE OTHER LIONS CAME AND HE RESTED HIS CHIN ON THE WOOD OF THE BOWS WHERE THE SHIP LAY ANCHORED WITH THE EVENING OFFSHORE BREEZE AND HE WAITED TO SEE IF THERE WOULD BE MORE LIONS AND HE WAS HAPPY THE MOON HAD BEEN UP FOR A LONG TIME BUT HE SLEPT ON AND THE FISH PULLED ON STEADILY AND THE BOAT MOVED INTO THE TUNNEL OF CLOUDS HE WOKE WITH THE JERK OF HIS RIGHT FIST COMING UP AGAINST HIS FACE AND THE LINE BURNING OUT THROUGH HIS RIGHT HAND HE HAD NO FEELING OF HIS LEFT HAND BUT HE BRAKED ALL HE COULD WITH HIS RIGHT AND THE LINE RUSHED OUT FINALLY HIS LEFT HAND FOUND THE LINE AND HE LEANED BACK AGAINST THE LINE AND NOW IT BURNED HIS
BACK AND HIS LEFT HAND AND HIS LEFT HAND WAS TAKING ALL THE STRAIN AND CUTTING BADLY HE LOOKED BACK AT THE COILS OF LINE AND THEY WERE FEEDING SMOOTHLY JUST THEN THE FISH JUMPED MAKING A GREAT BURSTING OF THE OCEAN AND THEN A HEAVY FALL THEN HE JUMPED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE BOAT WAS GOING FAST ALTHOUGH LINE WAS STILL RACING OUT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RAISING THE STRAIN TO BREAKING POINT AND RAISING IT TO BREAKING POINT AGAIN AND AGAIN HE HAD BEEN PULLED DOWN TIGHT ONTO THE BOW AND HIS FACE WAS IN THE CUT SLICE OF DOLPHIN AND HE COULD NOT MOVE THIS IS WHAT WE WAITED FOR HE THOUGHT SO NOW LET US TAKE IT MAKE HIM PAY FOR THE LINE HE THOUGHT MAKE HIM PAY FOR IT HE COULD NOT SEE THE FISHES JUMPS BUT ONLY HEARD THE BREAKING OF THE OCEAN AND THE HEAVY SPLASH AS HE FELL THE SPEED OF THE LINE WAS CUTTING HIS HANDS BADLY BUT HE HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THIS WOULD HAPPEN AND HE TRIED TO KEEP THE CUTTING ACROSS THE CALLOUSED PARTS AND NOT LET THE LINE SLIP INTO THE PALM NOR CUT THE FINGERS IF THE BOY WAS
HERE HE WOULD WET THE COILS OF LINE HE THOUGHT YES IF THE BOY WERE HERE IF THE BOY WERE HERE THE LINE WENT OUT AND OUT AND OUT BUT IT WAS SLOWING NOW AND HE WAS MAKING THE FISH EARN EACH INCH OF IT NOW HE GOT HIS HEAD UP FROM THE WOOD AND OUT OF THE SLICE OF FISH THAT HIS CHEEK HAD CRUSHED THEN HE WAS ON HIS KNEES AND THEN HE ROSE SLOWLY TO HIS FEET HE WAS CEDING LINE BUT MORE SLOWLY ALL THE TIME HE WORKED BACK TO WHERE HE COULD FEEL WITH HIS FOOT THE COILS OF LINE THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THERE WAS PLENTY OF LINE STILL AND NOW THE FISH HAD TO PULL THE FRICTION OF ALL THAT NEW LINE THROUGH THE WATER YES HE THOUGHT AND NOW HE HAS JUMPED MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES AND FILLED THE SACKS ALONG HIS BACK WITH AIR AND HE CANNOT GO DOWN DEEP TO DIE WHERE I CANNOT BRING HIM UP HE WILL START CIRCLING SOON AND THEN I MUST WORK ON HIM I WONDER WHAT STARTED HIM SO SUDDENLY COULD IT HAVE BEEN HUNGER THAT MADE HIM DESPERATE OR WAS HE FRIGHTENED BY SOMETHING IN THE NIGHT MAYBE HE SUDDENLY FELT FEAR BUT HE
WAS SUCH A CALM STRONG FISH AND HE SEEMED SO FEARLESS AND SO CONFIDENT IT IS STRANGE YOU BETTER BE FEARLESS AND CONFIDENT YOURSELF OLD MAN HE SAID YOURE HOLDING HIM AGAIN BUT YOU CANNOT GET LINE BUT SOON HE HAS TO CIRCLE THE OLD MAN HELD HIM WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND HIS SHOULDERS NOW AND STOOPED DOWN AND SCOOPED UP WATER IN HIS RIGHT HAND TO GET THE CRUSHED DOLPHIN FLESH OFF OF HIS FACE HE WAS AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT NAUSEATE HIM AND HE WOULD VOMIT AND LOSE HIS STRENGTH WHEN HIS FACE WAS CLEANED HE WASHED HIS RIGHT HAND IN THE WATER OVER THE SIDE AND THEN LET IT STAY IN THE SALT WATER WHILE HE WATCHED THE FIRST LIGHT COME BEFORE THE SUNRISE HES HEADED ALMOST EAST HE THOUGHT THAT MEANS HE IS TIRED AND GOING WITH THE CURRENT SOON HE WILL HAVE TO CIRCLE THEN OUR TRUE WORK BEGINS AFTER HE JUDGED THAT HIS RIGHT HAND HAD BEEN IN THE WATER LONG ENOUGH HE TOOK IT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT IT IS NOT BAD HE SAID AND PAIN DOES NOT MATTER TO A MAN HE TOOK HOLD OF THE LINE CAREFULLY SO THAT IT DID NOT FIT
INTO ANY OF THE FRESH LINE CUTS AND SHIFTED HIS WEIGHT SO THAT HE COULD PUT HIS LEFT HAND INTO THE SEA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SKIFF YOU DID NOT DO SO BADLY FOR SOMETHING WORTHLESS HE SAID TO HIS LEFT HAND BUT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN I COULD NOT FIND YOU WHY WAS I NOT BORN WITH TWO GOOD HANDS HE THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS MY FAULT IN NOT TRAINING THAT ONE PROPERLY BUT GOD KNOWS HE HAS HAD ENOUGH CHANCES TO LEARN HE DID NOT DO SO BADLY IN THE NIGHT THOUGH AND HE HAS ONLY CRAMPED ONCE IF HE CRAMPS AGAIN LET THE LINE CUT HIM OFF WHEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT BEING CLEARHEADED AND HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD CHEW SOME MORE OF THE DOLPHIN BUT I CANT HE TOLD HIMSELF IT IS BETTER TO BE LIGHTHEADED THAN TO LOSE YOUR STRENGTH FROM NAUSEA AND I KNOW I CANNOT KEEP IT IF I EAT IT SINCE MY FACE WAS IN IT I WILL KEEP IT FOR AN EMERGENCY UNTIL IT GOES BAD BUT IT IS TOO LATE TO TRY FOR STRENGTH NOW THROUGH NOURISHMENT YOURE STUPID HE TOLD HIMSELF EAT THE OTHER FLYING FISH IT WAS THERE CLEANED AND
READY AND HE PICKED IT UP WITH HIS LEFT HAND AND ATE IT CHEWING THE BONES CAREFULLY AND EATING ALL OF IT DOWN TO THE TAIL IT HAS MORE NOURISHMENT THAN ALMOST ANY FISH HE THOUGHT AT LEAST THE KIND OF STRENGTH THAT I NEED NOW I HAVE DONE WHAT I CAN HE THOUGHT LET HIM BEGIN TO CIRCLE AND LET THE FIGHT COME THE SUN WAS RISING FOR THE THIRD TIME SINCE HE HAD PUT TO SEA WHEN THE FISH STARTED TO CIRCLE HE COULD NOT SEE BY THE SLANT OF THE LINE THAT THE FISH WAS CIRCLING IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR THAT HE JUST FELT A FAINT SLACKENING OF THE PRESSURE OF THE LINE AND HE COMMENCED TO PULL ON IT GENTLY WITH HIS RIGHT HAND IT TIGHTENED AS ALWAYS BUT JUST WHEN HE REACHED THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD BREAK LINE BEGAN TO COME IN HE SLIPPED HIS SHOULDERS AND HEAD FROM UNDER THE LINE AND BEGAN TO PULL IN LINE STEADILY AND GENTLY HE USED BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN A SWINGING MOTION AND TRIED TO DO THE PULLING AS MUCH AS HE COULD WITH HIS BODY AND HIS LEGS HIS OLD LEGS AND SHOULDERS PIVOTED WITH THE SWINGING OF THE
PULLING IT IS A VERY BIG CIRCLE HE SAID BUT HE IS CIRCLING THEN THE LINE WOULD NOT COME IN ANY MORE AND HE HELD IT UNTIL HE SAW THE DROPS JUMPING FROM IT IN THE SUN THEN IT STARTED OUT AND THE OLD MAN KNELT DOWN AND LET IT GO GRUDGINGLY BACK INTO THE DARK WATER HE IS MAKING THE FAR PART OF HIS CIRCLE NOW HE SAID I MUST HOLD ALL I CAN HE THOUGHT THE STRAIN WILL SHORTEN HIS CIRCLE EACH TIME PERHAPS IN AN HOUR I WILL SEE HIM NOW I MUST CONVINCE HIM AND THEN I MUST KILL HIM BUT THE FISH KEPT ON CIRCLING SLOWLY AND THE OLD MAN WAS WET WITH SWEAT AND TIRED DEEP INTO HIS BONES TWO HOURS LATER BUT THE CIRCLES WERE MUCH SHORTER NOW AND FROM THE WAY THE LINE SLANTED HE COULD TELL THE FISH HAD RISEN STEADILY WHILE HE SWAM FOR AN HOUR THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN SEEING BLACK SPOTS BEFORE HIS EYES AND THE SWEAT SALTED HIS EYES AND SALTED THE CUT OVER HIS EYE AND ON HIS FOREHEAD HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF THE BLACK SPOTS THEY WERE NORMAL AT THE TENSION THAT HE WAS PULLING ON THE LINE TWICE THOUGH HE HAD FELT

ALL HIS WEIGHT AFTER IT THEN THE FISH CAME ALIVE WITH HIS DEATH IN HIM AND ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE WATER SHOWING ALL HIS GREAT LENGTH AND WIDTH AND ALL HIS POWER AND HIS BEAUTY HE SEEMED TO HANG IN THE AIR ABOVE THE OLD MAN IN THE SKIFF THEN HE FELL INTO THE WATER WITH A CRASH THAT SENT SPRAY OVER THE OLD MAN AND OVER ALL OF THE SKIFF THE OLD MAN FELT FAINT AND SICK AND HE COULD NOT SEE WELL BUT HE CLEARED THE HARPOON LINE AND LET IT RUN SLOWLY THROUGH HIS RAW HANDS AND WHEN HE COULD SEE HE SAW THE FISH WAS ON HIS BACK WITH HIS SILVER BELLY UP THE SHAFT OF THE HARPOON WAS PROJECTING AT AN ANGLE FROM THE FISHES SHOULDER AND THE SEA WAS DISCOLOURING WITH THE RED OF THE BLOOD FROM HIS HEART FIRST IT WAS DARK AS A SHOAL IN THE BLUE WATER THAT WAS MORE THAN A MILE DEEP THEN IT SPREAD LIKE A CLOUD THE FISH WAS SILVERY AND STILL AND FLOATED WITH THE WAVES THE OLD MAN LOOKED CAREFULLY IN THE GLIMPSE OF VISION THAT HE HAD THEN HE TOOK TWO TURNS OF THE HARPOON LINE AROUND THE IN THE BOW AND LAID
HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS KEEP MY HEAD CLEAR HE SAID AGAINST THE WOOD OF THE BOW I AM A TIRED OLD MAN BUT I HAVE KILLED THIS FISH WHICH IS MY BROTHER AND NOW I MUST DO THE SLAVE WORK NOW I MUST PREPARE THE NOOSES AND THE ROPE TO LASH HIM ALONGSIDE HE THOUGHT EVEN IF WE WERE TWO AND SWAMPED HER TO LOAD HIM AND BAILED HER OUT THIS SKIFF WOULD NEVER HOLD HIM I MUST PREPARE EVERYTHING THEN BRING HIM IN AND LASH HIM WELL AND STEP THE MAST AND SET SAIL FOR HOME HE STARTED TO PULL THE FISH IN TO HAVE HIM ALONGSIDE SO THAT HE COULD PASS A LINE THROUGH HIS GILLS AND OUT HIS MOUTH AND MAKE HIS HEAD FAST ALONGSIDE THE BOW I WANT TO SEE HIM HE THOUGHT AND TO TOUCH AND TO FEEL HIM HE IS MY FORTUNE HE THOUGHT BUT THAT IS NOT WHY I WISH TO FEEL HIM I THINK I FELT HIS HEART HE THOUGHT WHEN I PUSHED ON THE HARPOON SHAFT THE SECOND TIME BRING HIM IN NOW AND MAKE HIM FAST AND GET THE NOOSE AROUND HIS TAIL AND ANOTHER AROUND HIS MIDDLE TO BIND HIM TO THE SKIFF GET TO WORK OLD MAN HE SAID HE TOOK A VERY SMALL
DRINK OF THE WATER THERE IS VERY MUCH SLAVE WORK TO BE DONE NOW THAT THE FIGHT IS OVER HE LOOKED UP AT THE SKY AND THEN OUT TO HIS FISH HE LOOKED AT THE SUN CAREFULLY IT IS NOT MUCH MORE THAN NOON HE THOUGHT AND THE TRADE WIND IS RISING THE LINES ALL MEAN NOTHING NOW THE BOY AND I WILL SPLICE THEM WHEN WE ARE HOME COME ON FISH HE SAID BUT THE FISH DID NOT COME INSTEAD HE LAY THERE WALLOWING NOW IN THE SEAS AND THE OLD MAN PULLED THE SKIFF UP ONTO HIM WHEN HE WAS EVEN WITH HIM AND HAD THE FISHES HEAD AGAINST THE BOW HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS SIZE BUT HE UNTIED THE HARPOON ROPE FROM THE PASSED IT THROUGH THE FISHES GILLS AND OUT HIS JAWS MADE A TURN AROUND HIS SWORD THEN PASSED THE ROPE THROUGH THE OTHER GILL MADE ANOTHER TURN AROUND THE BILL AND KNOTTED THE DOUBLE ROPE AND MADE IT FAST TO THE IN THE BOW HE CUT THE ROPE THEN AND WENT ASTERN TO NOOSE THE TAIL THE FISH HAD TURNED SILVER FROM HIS ORIGINAL PURPLE AND SILVER AND THE STRIPES SHOWED THE SAME PALE VIOLET COLOUR AS HIS TAIL THEY
WERE WIDER THAN A MANS HAND WITH HIS FINGERS SPREAD AND THE FISHES EYE LOOKED AS DETACHED AS THE MIRRORS IN A PERISCOPE OR AS A SAINT IN A PROCESSION IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO KILL HIM THE OLD MAN SAID HE WAS FEELING BETTER SINCE THE WATER AND HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT GO AWAY AND HIS HEAD WAS CLEAR HES OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS THE WAY HE IS HE THOUGHT MAYBE MUCH MORE IF HE DRESSES OUT TWO THIRDS OF THAT AT THIRTY CENTS A POUND I NEED A PENCIL FOR THAT HE SAID MY HEAD IS NOT THAT CLEAR BUT I THINK THE GREAT WOULD BE PROUD OF ME TODAY I HAD NO BONE SPURS BUT THE HANDS AND THE BACK HURT TRULY I WONDER WHAT A BONE SPUR IS HE THOUGHT MAYBE WE HAVE THEM WITHOUT KNOWING OF IT HE MADE THE FISH FAST TO BOW AND STERN AND TO THE MIDDLE THWART HE WAS SO BIG IT WAS LIKE LASHING A MUCH BIGGER SKIFF ALONGSIDE HE CUT A PIECE OF LINE AND TIED THE FISHES LOWER JAW AGAINST HIS BILL SO HIS MOUTH WOULD NOT OPEN AND THEY WOULD SAIL AS CLEANLY AS POSSIBLE THEN HE STEPPED THE MAST AND WITH THE STICK THAT WAS HIS
GAFF AND WITH HIS BOOM RIGGED THE PATCHED SAIL DREW THE BOAT BEGAN TO MOVE AND HALF LYING IN THE STERN HE SAILED SOUTHWEST HE DID NOT NEED A COMPASS TO TELL HIM WHERE SOUTHWEST WAS HE ONLY NEEDED THE FEEL OF THE TRADE WIND AND THE DRAWING OF THE SAIL I BETTER PUT A SMALL LINE OUT WITH A SPOON ON IT AND TRY AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND DRINK FOR THE MOISTURE BUT HE COULD NOT FIND A SPOON AND HIS SARDINES WERE ROTTEN SO HE HOOKED A PATCH OF YELLOW GULF WEED WITH THE GAFF AS THEY PASSED AND SHOOK IT SO THAT THE SMALL SHRIMPS THAT WERE IN IT FELL ONTO THE PLANKING OF THE SKIFF THERE WERE MORE THAN A DOZEN OF THEM AND THEY JUMPED AND KICKED LIKE SAND FLEAS THE OLD MAN PINCHED THEIR HEADS OFF WITH HIS THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND ATE THEM CHEWING UP THE SHELLS AND THE TAILS THEY WERE VERY TINY BUT HE KNEW THEY WERE NOURISHING AND THEY TASTED GOOD THE OLD MAN STILL HAD TWO DRINKS OF WATER IN THE BOTTLE AND HE USED HALF OF ONE AFTER HE HAD EATEN THE SHRIMPS THE SKIFF WAS SAILING WELL CONSIDERING
THE HANDICAPS AND HE STEERED WITH THE TILLER UNDER HIS ARM HE COULD SEE THE FISH AND HE HAD ONLY TO LOOK AT HIS HANDS AND FEEL HIS BACK AGAINST THE STERN TO KNOW THAT THIS HAD TRULY HAPPENED AND WAS NOT A DREAM AT ONE TIME WHEN HE WAS FEELING SO BADLY TOWARD THE END HE HAD THOUGHT PERHAPS IT WAS A DREAM THEN WHEN HE HAD SEEN THE FISH COME OUT OF THE WATER AND HANG MOTIONLESS IN THE SKY BEFORE HE FELL HE WAS SURE THERE WAS SOME GREAT STRANGENESS AND HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT THEN HE COULD NOT SEE WELL ALTHOUGH NOW HE SAW AS WELL AS EVER NOW HE KNEW THERE WAS THE FISH AND HIS HANDS AND BACK WERE NO DREAM THE HANDS CURE QUICKLY HE THOUGHT I BLED THEM CLEAN AND THE SALT WATER WILL HEAL THEM THE DARK WATER OF THE TRUE GULF IS THE GREATEST HEALER THAT THERE IS ALL I MUST DO IS KEEP THE HEAD CLEAR THE HANDS HAVE DONE THEIR WORK AND WE SAIL WELL WITH HIS MOUTH SHUT AND HIS TAIL STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN WE SAIL LIKE BROTHERS THEN HIS HEAD STARTED TO BECOME A LITTLE UNCLEAR AND HE THOUGHT IS HE
BRINGING ME IN OR AM I BRINGING HIM IN IF I WERE TOWING HIM BEHIND THERE WOULD BE NO QUESTION NOR IF THE FISH WERE IN THE SKIFF WITH ALL DIGNITY GONE THERE WOULD BE NO QUESTION EITHER BUT THEY WERE SAILING TOGETHER LASHED SIDE BY SIDE AND THE OLD MAN THOUGHT LET HIM BRING ME IN IF IT PLEASES HIM I AM ONLY BETTER THAN HIM THROUGH TRICKERY AND HE MEANT ME NO HARM THEY SAILED WELL AND THE OLD MAN SOAKED HIS HANDS IN THE SALT WATER AND TRIED TO KEEP HIS HEAD CLEAR THERE WERE HIGH CUMULUS CLOUDS AND ENOUGH CIRRUS ABOVE THEM SO THAT THE OLD MAN KNEW THE BREEZE WOULD LAST ALL NIGHT THE OLD MAN LOOKED AT THE FISH CONSTANTLY TO MAKE SURE IT WAS TRUE IT WAS AN HOUR BEFORE THE FIRST SHARK HIT HIM THE SHARK WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT HE HAD COME UP FROM DEEP DOWN IN THE WATER AS THE DARK CLOUD OF BLOOD HAD SETTLED AND DISPERSED IN THE MILE DEEP SEA HE HAD COME UP SO FAST AND ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT CAUTION THAT HE BROKE THE SURFACE OF THE BLUE WATER AND WAS IN THE SUN THEN HE FELL BACK INTO THE SEA AND PICKED
UP THE SCENT AND STARTED SWIMMING ON THE COURSE THE SKIFF AND THE FISH HAD TAKEN SOMETIMES HE LOST THE SCENT BUT HE WOULD PICK IT UP AGAIN OR HAVE JUST A TRACE OF IT AND HE SWAM FAST AND HARD ON THE COURSE HE WAS A VERY BIG MAKO SHARK BUILT TO SWIM AS FAST AS THE FASTEST FISH IN THE SEA AND EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS BEAUTIFUL EXCEPT HIS JAWS HIS BACK WAS AS BLUE AS A SWORD FISHES AND HIS BELLY WAS SILVER AND HIS HIDE WAS SMOOTH AND HANDSOME HE WAS BUILT AS A SWORD FISH EXCEPT FOR HIS HUGE JAWS WHICH WERE TIGHT SHUT NOW AS HE SWAM FAST JUST UNDER THE SURFACE WITH HIS HIGH DORSAL FIN KNIFING THROUGH THE WATER WITHOUT WAVERING INSIDE THE CLOSED DOUBLE LIP OF HIS JAWS ALL OF HIS EIGHT ROWS OF TEETH WERE SLANTED INWARDS THEY WERE NOT THE ORDINARY PYRAMID SHAPED TEETH OF MOST SHARKS THEY WERE SHAPED LIKE A MANS FINGERS WHEN THEY ARE CRISPED LIKE CLAWS THEY WERE NEARLY AS LONG AS THE FINGERS OF THE OLD MAN AND THEY HAD RAZOR SHARP CUTTING EDGES ON BOTH SIDES THIS WAS A FISH BUILT TO FEED ON
ALL THE FISHES IN THE SEA THAT WERE SO FAST AND STRONG AND WELL ARMED THAT THEY HAD NO OTHER ENEMY NOW HE SPEEDED UP AS HE SMELLED THE FRESHER SCENT AND HIS BLUE DORSAL FIN CUT THE WATER WHEN THE OLD MAN SAW HIM COMING HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A SHARK THAT HAD NO FEAR AT ALL AND WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT HE WISHED HE PREPARED THE HARPOON AND MADE THE ROPE FAST WHILE HE WATCHED THE SHARK COME ON THE ROPE WAS SHORT AS IT LACKED WHAT HE HAD CUT AWAY TO LASH THE FISH THE OLD MANS HEAD WAS CLEAR AND GOOD NOW AND HE WAS FULL OF RESOLUTION BUT HE HAD LITTLE HOPE IT WAS TOO GOOD TO LAST HE THOUGHT HE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE GREAT FISH AS HE WATCHED THE SHARK CLOSE IN IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN A DREAM HE THOUGHT I CANNOT KEEP HIM FROM HITTING ME BUT MAYBE I CAN GET HIM HE THOUGHT BAD LUCK TO YOUR MOTHER THE SHARK CLOSED FAST ASTERN AND WHEN HE HIT THE FISH THE OLD MAN SAW HIS MOUTH OPEN AND HIS STRANGE EYES AND THE CLICKING CHOP OF THE TEETH AS HE DROVE FORWARD IN THE MEAT JUST ABOVE THE TAIL THE SHARKS
HEAD WAS OUT OF WATER AND HIS BACK WAS COMING OUT AND THE OLD MAN COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF SKIN AND FLESH RIPPING ON THE BIG FISH WHEN HE RAMMED THE HARPOON DOWN ONTO THE SHARKS HEAD AT A SPOT WHERE THE LINE BETWEEN HIS EYES INTERSECTED WITH THE LINE THAT RAN STRAIGHT BACK FROM HIS NOSE THERE WERE NO SUCH LINES THERE WAS ONLY THE HEAVY SHARP BLUE HEAD AND THE BIG EYES AND THE CLICKING THRUSTING ALL SWALLOWING JAWS BUT THAT WAS THE LOCATION OF THE BRAIN AND THE OLD MAN HIT IT HE HIT IT WITH HIS BLOOD MUSHED HANDS DRIVING A GOOD HARPOON WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH HE HIT IT WITHOUT HOPE BUT WITH RESOLUTION AND COMPLETE MALIGNANCY THE SHARK SWUNG OVER AND THE OLD MAN SAW HIS EYE WAS NOT ALIVE AND THEN HE SWUNG OVER ONCE AGAIN WRAPPING HIMSELF IN TWO LOOPS OF THE ROPE THE OLD MAN KNEW THAT HE WAS DEAD BUT THE SHARK WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT THEN ON HIS BACK WITH HIS TAIL LASHING AND HIS JAWS CLICKING THE SHARK PLOWED OVER THE WATER AS A SPEEDBOAT DOES THE WATER WAS WHITE WHERE HIS TAIL BEAT IT AND

HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT AT THE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO GUIDE US THROUGH SOME QUESTIONS CNN WHAT IS HOSPICE CARE AND WHO QUALIFIES FOR IT DR HOSPICE CARE IS A TYPE OF SPECIALTY MEDICAL CARE FOR PEOPLE NEAR THE END OF THEIR LIVES THAT FOCUSES ON MAXIMIZING COMFORT FOR THE PATIENT AND SUPPORT FOR THE PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILY THAT INCLUDES REDUCING PHYSICAL PAIN AND TENDING TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF THE PATIENT AND THE FAMILY GENERALLY TO QUALIFY FOR HOSPICE CARE THE PATIENT MUST HAVE AN INCURABLE MEDICAL CONDITION WITH AN ANTICIPATED LIFE EXPECTANCY OF LESS THAN SIX MONTHS THE TYPES OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT PATIENTS HAVE INCLUDE END STAGE CANCER ADVANCED DEMENTIA HEART FAILURE AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE CNN WHERE DO PATIENTS RECEIVE HOSPICE CARE AND WHO PROVIDES IT HOSPICE CARE IS AN APPROACH TO MEDICAL CARE NOT A SPECIFIC PLACE SO IT CAN BE PROVIDED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SETTINGS THE CHOICE OF
SETTINGS IS UP TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY PROVIDERS ARE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF PHYSICIANS NURSES HOME HEALTH AIDES PHARMACISTS AND OTHERS WHO WILL TEND TO THE PATIENT NO MATTER WHAT SETTING THEY CHOOSE FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY WALKS WITH HIS WIFE AFTER TEACHING SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS IN PLAINS GEORGIA IN FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY WALKS WITH HIS WIFE AFTER TEACHING SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS IN PLAINS GEORGIA IN MANY PATIENTS OPT TO RECEIVE HOSPICE CARE IN THEIR HOMES WHERE THEY CAN BE IN FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS THE HOSPICE TEAM HELPS TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES AND STAFF TO ASSIST THE FAMILY TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONE THEY PROVIDE REGULAR HOME VISITS AND ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE AROUND THE CLOCK FOR CONCERNS AS THEY COME UP HOSPICE CAN ALSO BE DELIVERED IN A NURSING HOME OR AT THE HOSPITAL IN ADDITION THERE ARE SPECIALIZED HOSPICE CENTERS CNN WHAT ARE SOME COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS OF HOSPICE CARE THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT HOSPICE CARE IS GIVING UP ON MEDICAL CARE ACTUALLY HOSPICE CARE IS A
SPECIFIC TYPE OF COMPASSIONATE MEDICAL CARE FOR PATIENTS IN THE LAST STAGES OF INCURABLE DISEASE TO LIVE AS FULLY AND COMFORTABLY AS THEY CAN A PRIMARY AIM OF HOSPICE CARE IS TO MANAGE THE PATIENTS SYMPTOMS SO THAT THE PATIENTS LAST DAYS CAN BE SPENT WITH THEIR LOVED ONES WITH DIGNITY AND THE HIGHEST QUALITY POSSIBLE THE WISDOM PROJECT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOODNIGHT ILLUSTRATION A GOOD DEATH BY GOING GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT A SECOND MISCONCEPTION IS THAT ONCE A PATIENT ENTERS HOSPICE CARE THEY CAN NO LONGER RECEIVE ANY MEDICAL TREATMENT THIS IS NOT TRUE PATIENTS RECEIVE MEDICINES TO HELP THEIR SYMPTOMS AND ALLEVIATE THEIR PAIN THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO LEAVE HOSPICE AT ANY POINT AND RESUME SAY ACTIVE TREATMENT FOR THEIR CANCER IVE ALSO HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT HOSPICE CARE IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WITH A FEW DAYS TO LIVE THIS IS ALSO NOT THE CASE OFTEN PATIENTS DONT BEGIN HOSPICE CARE SOON ENOUGH TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE HELP IT OFFERS BEGINNING IT EARLIER MAY HELP

NUANCE THE STRUGGLES OF A WHITE WOMAN IN THE WORKFORCE MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE COMPARABLE OR EVEN AT ALL SIMILAR TO THOSE OF A BLACK WORKING WOMAN AND IN TURN A BLACK WORKING WOMAN MAY TEND TO FACE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BARRIERS TO THOSE EXPERIENCED BY WOMEN OF MIDDLE EASTERN HISPANIC OR ASIAN DESCENT NOW AS THE EFFECTS OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS BEGIN TO CRYSTALLISE RESEARCHERS STRESS ITS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WOMEN OF COLOUR IN THE PAID LABOUR MARKET HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY A PERFECT STORM OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT HAVE PLAYED HAVOC WITH THEIR PAY AND EARNINGS POTENTIAL NOT ONLY WERE WOMEN OF COLOUR MORE LIKELY TO BE LAID OFF DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE BUT EVIDENCE HAS ALSO EMERGED THAT DURING THE MOST RECENT WAVE OF JOB CUTS THEY WERE MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS TO HAVE BEEN MADE REDUNDANT TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN CUTTING AND SHELVING DIVERSITY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT WOMEN OF COLOUR IN THE WORKFORCE
THIS CONFLUENCE HAS LEFT WOMEN OF COLOUR AT A PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGE AND IN THEIR QUEST TO ADVANCE IN THE WORKFORCE AND BOOST THEIR EARNINGS THEY MAY NOW FACE AN EVEN STEEPER CLIMB THAN BEFORE SOMETHING THAT EMPLOYERS SAY EXPERTS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS WOMEN OF COLOUR HAVE BEEN LEFT AT A PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGE IN THE PANDEMIC ERA CREDIT IMAGES WOMEN OF COLOUR HAVE BEEN LEFT AT A PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGE IN THE PANDEMIC ERA CREDIT IMAGES A PERFECT STORM EVEN THOUGH WOMEN OF COLOUR HAVE ALWAYS EARNED LESS AND ENDURED WORSE REPRESENTATION IN MANAGEMENT ROLES ACROSS THE CORPORATE WORLD THE PAST THREE YEARS HAVE SERVED UP A CRUSH OF ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FIRST THEIR WORKFORCE REPRESENTATION HAS FALLEN AT AN ALARMING RATE IN THE US RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WOMEN OF COLOUR AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH CHILDCARE RESPONSIBILITIES WERE MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE THE WORKFORCE DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC AND THE LATEST WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE REPORT COMPILED BY CONSULTING FIRM COMPANY IN COLLABORATION
WITH WOMENS WORKPLACE EQUALITY NONPROFIT LEAN IN SHOWED THAT AMONG THE UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF WOMEN LEAVING THEIR EMPLOYERS THE PHENOMENON IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED FOR WOMEN OF COLOUR FOR THOSE WHO DO REMAIN IN THE WORKFORCE MANY ARE ENCOUNTERING WHAT COINS THE BROKEN RUNG AT THE FIRST STEP UP THE LADDER TO MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO THEIR MOST RECENT RESEARCH FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED MEN WHO ARE PROMOTED FROM ENTRY LEVEL TO MANAGER ONLY EIGHTY SEVEN WOMEN ARE PROMOTED AND ONLY EIGHTY TWO WOMEN OF COLOUR ARE PROMOTED THIS IS PARTICULARLY WORRYING SAYS AN ASSOCIATE MANAGEMENT PROFESSOR AT COLLEGE US SINCE EARNINGS POTENTIAL CORRELATES STRONGLY TO SENIORITY SHE NOTES THAT WHILE TWENTY ONE OF SUITE LEADERS IN THE US ARE WOMEN ONLY FOUR ARE WOMEN OF COLOUR AND JUST ONE ARE BLACK WOMEN SAYS THAT WHILE ITS NOTHING NEW THAT EMPLOYEES OF COLOUR AND PARTICULARLY WOMEN HAVE TENDED TO EARN LESS AND BE LESS REPRESENTED IN THE MOST SENIOR RANKS OF THE CORPORATE WORLD THE MOST RECENT HEADWINDS ARE
TROUBLING THE ONGOING CORPORATE CUTS ARE ALSO TAKING A TOLL ON THIS GROUP AFFECTING THEIR CURRENT ROLES AS WELL AS CRITICAL SUPPORT STRUCTURES ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO HARD DATA THAT INDICATES WOMEN OF COLOUR HAVE BEEN LAID OFF IN HIGHER NUMBERS THAN OTHER WORKERS RESEARCH BY SCHOLAR AT TEL AVIV UNIVERSITY SHOWS THAT LAYOFFS DO TEND TO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT WOMEN AND MINORITIES ESPECIALLY MANAGERS AND PARTICULARLY WHEN CUTS ARE DETERMINED BY THE TENURE THAT AN EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN AT AN ORGANISATION AND BY THE POSITION THAT THEY HOLD IN OTHER WORDS WOMEN AND MINORITIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN AT THE COMPANY FOR MANY YEARS AND ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO BE IN A SENIOR POSITION THAN A WHITE MAN THIS MAKES THEM MORE LIKELY TO BE DEEMED NONESSENTIAL MORE VULNERABLE TO CUTS WOMEN AND MINORITIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN AT THE COMPANY FOR MANY YEARS AND ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO BE IN A SENIOR POSITION THAN A WHITE MAN THIS MAKES THEM MORE LIKELY TO BE DEEMED NONESSENTIAL THE IMPORTANT
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PROGRAMMES THAT EMPLOYEES OF COLOUR RELY ON FOR ADVANCEMENT ARE ALSO BEING THREATENED EARLY DATA INDICATES THAT DURING THE RECENT WAVE OF MASS LAYOFFS AND PARTICULARLY IN THE TECH SECTOR THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AMONG OTHER COMPANIES TWITTER IS A HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLE AND IF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY LINGERS AND COMPANIES CONTINUE TO CUT BUDGETS SLASHED FUNDING COULD DISCOURAGE ORGANISATIONS FROM REINSTATING OR BOLSTERING EFFORTS AND FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS THE DYNAMICS DISADVANTAGE WOMEN OF COLOUR OTHER CUTS MAY ALSO BE STALLING OUT ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN OF COLOUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN COMPANIES OFFER WORK LIFE SUPPORTS SUCH AS THE OPTION TO WORK FLEXIBLY FAMILY LEAVE AND HELP WITH CHILDCARE WOMEN AND ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOUR AS WELL AS MEN OF COLOUR ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED CLIMBING INTO MANAGEMENT JOBS BUT THESE ARE BENEFITS THAT CAN FALL BY THE WAYSIDE WHEN ECONOMIC HEADWINDS PICK UP WITHOUT SUCH
WORK LIFE SUPPORTS IT IS MUCH HARDER FOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOUR TO KEEP THEIR JOBS AND CLIMB UP THE RANKS SAYS A PAY CHALLENGE IF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY WOMEN OF COLOUR PERSIST OR GET WORSE ONE OF THE MAJOR KNOCK ON EFFECTS WILL BE ON EARNINGS THERE IS ALREADY A SIGNIFICANT PAY GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IN MOST COUNTRIES IN THE US FOR EXAMPLE DATA SHOWS THAT FOR EVERY US DOLLAR A MEDIAN MAN WORKING FULL TIME MAKES A MEDIAN WOMAN EARNS ABOUT EIGHTY THREE CENTS IN THE UK USING THE SAME PARAMETERS THE GAP IS MARGINALLY SMALLER AT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PENCE TO THE BRITISH POUND ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS THE GLOBAL GAP IS ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN CENTS TO THE DOLLAR PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY WOMEN BEING UNDERREPRESENTED IN DECISIONMAKING ROLES DOING MORE UNPAID WORK THAN MEN AND BEING OVERREPRESENTED IN LOWER SKILLED AND LOWER INCOME WORK DISCRIMINATION MAY ALSO FACTOR IN BUT THATS SOMETHING THATS HARD TO MEASURE AND OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PROVE MEANING THAT IT CAN PERSIST FOR YEARS UNNOTICED
YET WOMEN OF COLOUR EARN EVEN LESS RESEARCH FROM THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS CAP FOR EXAMPLE SHOWED THAT IN THE US HISPANIC WOMEN EARNED JUST FIFTY SEVEN CENTS FOR EVERY ONE EARNED BY WHITE NON HISPANIC MEN IN FOR BLACK WOMEN IN THE US THE WAGE GAP MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE OF IN LOST WAGES OVER A FORTY YEAR CAREER WHILE RESULTING IN LOSSES OF FOR LATINAS AND FOR NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE UK DATA SHOWS PAKISTANI WOMEN EARNED ABOUT SIXTY NINE PENCE FOR EACH POUND EARNED BY A MAN AS WOMEN OF COLOUR LOSE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT AND WORKFORCE TENURE IT WILL BE CHALLENGING TO CLOSE THIS EARNINGS GAP AND ENABLE THEM TO GAIN FOOTING IN PAY EQUALITY AS WOMEN OF COLOUR LOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT IT WILL BE HARDER TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP CREDIT IMAGES AS WOMEN OF COLOUR LOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADVANCEMENT IT WILL BE HARDER TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP CREDIT IMAGES AND WHILE WOMEN OF COLOUR ARE SET BACK LOSING ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT THESE ISSUES CAN BE TOUGH TO REVERSE
THIS IS DEEPLY TROUBLING SAYS FOUNDER OF EQUALITY GROUP A LONDON BASED CONSULTANCY THAT FOCUSES ON INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN THE FINANCE AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY SHE SAYS THAT THESE EFFECTS ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNING BECAUSE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH BEING UNDERPAID COMPARED TO ANOTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP ACCUMULATE AND GROW OVER TIME AS A RESULT WOMEN OF COLOUR ARE LESS ABLE TO BUILD SAVINGS WITHSTAND ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND ACHIEVE SOME MEASURE OF ECONOMIC STABILITY THEY ARE OFTEN THE SAME WOMEN WHO ARE CARING FOR OTHERS AND SUPPORTING MANY COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES THIS POTENTIALLY GROWING DISCREPANCY CAN ALSO HAVE WIDESPREAD IMPLICATIONS ADDS IT IS NOT ONLY A DEEP LOSS FOR THE WORKPLACE IT ENDS UP HAVING A LARGE IMPACT ON SOCIETY MORE BROADLY SHE SAYS WHEN WE INVEST IN WOMEN OF COLOUR WE ARE SUPPORTING WHOLE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO APPRECIATE THE OUTSIZED IMPACT REVERSING THIS GAP CAN HAVE ON OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY AN EXTENSIVE DIVERSITY PENALTY EXPERTS AGREE THAT EMPLOYERS MUST
BEAR THE BRUNT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT WOMEN OF COLOUR DONT FALL EVEN FURTHER BEHIND THEIR PEERS IN THE WORKPLACE AS A FIRST STEP SAYS COMPANIES CAN START TAKING ACTION BY UNDERSTANDING THE EXTENT OF THESE CONDITIONS AND COLLECTING MORE NUANCED DATA AROUND THEM PAY REPORTS SHE SAYS CAN BE A USEFUL RESOURCE TO GAUGE AND ACKNOWLEDGE JUST HOW MUCH WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE SOME COUNTRIES LIKE THE UK MANDATE ANNUAL GENDER PAY GAP REPORTING FOR ORGANISATIONS OF A CERTAIN SIZE BUT DONT REQUIRE COMPANIES TO BREAK DOWN GENDER PAY DATA INTO CATEGORIES THAT INCLUDE RACE FOR EXAMPLE THAT SAY SOME EXPERTS COULD BE ONE WAY OF SHINING A LIGHT ON THE SEVERITY AND URGENCY OF THE PROBLEM SUBSEQUENTLY ITS IMPORTANT FOR FIRMS TO ALSO RECOGNISE THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS EXACERBATING PAY GAP ISSUES ESPECIALLY AMID CURRENT CONDITIONS AS THOSE WITH THE POWER TO IMPLEMENT CHANGE AT A HIGHER LEVEL THE RESPONSIBILITY LIES ON THE SHOULDERS OF EMPLOYERS AND MANAGERS TO ACKNOWLEDGE ADDRESS AND REMEDY ALL
RACIAL AND GENDER PAY GAPS AGREES OF EMPLOYERS MUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE ROLE OF INTERSECTIONAL IN PAY DISCREPANCIES AND ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE COMPENSATED IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER SHE SAYS IT IS NOT ONLY A DEEP LOSS FOR THE WORKPLACE IT ENDS UP HAVING A LARGE IMPACT ON SOCIETY MORE BROADLY WITHOUT ACTIVE INTERVENTION THE GAP WILL KEEP WIDENING SAYS OFTEN MANAGERS ARE UNAWARE OF THE MANY WAYS THEY CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THEY NEED TO SEE THE DATA RECEIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND ESTABLISH STRUCTURES TO ENSURE WOMEN OF COLOUR ARENT CONTINUING TO PAY SUCH AN EXTENSIVE DIVERSITY PENALTY EVEN WITH THESE COMPOUNDING FACTORS IN PLAY HOWEVER NOT EVERY DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS GRIM IMPLICATIONS FOR WOMEN OF COLOUR FOR EXAMPLE SOME EXPERTS ARE HOPEFUL THAT NEW US LAWS BANNING EMPLOYERS FROM ASKING SALARY HISTORY COULD HELP TO STEM THE WIDENING IN PAY GAPS WHEN EMPLOYERS ARE ABLE TO ASK ABOUT SALARY HISTORY BEFORE MAKING A PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEE A MONETARY OFFER THAT ENABLES
A FORM OF INSTITUTIONAL DISCRIMINATION AND THE PERPETUATION OF WAGE GAPS THAT CAN PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGE WOMEN AND EMPLOYEES OF COLOUR ACCORDING TO A PAPER PUBLISHED BY ACADEMICS AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY EVEN IF EMPLOYERS DO NOT INDIVIDUALLY DISCRIMINATE THE USE OF SALARY HISTORIES APPEARS TO PERPETUATE THE EFFECTS OF PAST DISCRIMINATION OR OTHER GROUP INEQUITIES THEY ADD DATA FROM THE NATIONAL WOMENS LAW CENTER A US BASED NONPROFIT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT SALARY HISTORY BANS CAN BE EFFECTIVE AT MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN OF COLOUR ARE PAID FAIRLY RESEARCH SHOWS TOO THAT WOMEN AND MINORITY WORKERS TEND TO ASK FOR LESS MONEY SO SOME EXPERTS ALSO PREDICT THAT THAT INCOMING SALARY TRANSPARENCY LAWS MANDATES TO PUBLISH PAY RANGES ON JOB ADVERTISEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE COULD HELP TO STAMP OUT INEQUITY LEVELLING PAY IS OF COURSE ONLY ONE PART OF THE PUZZLE AS RESEARCH SHOWS FOR EXAMPLE EMPLOYEES NEED TO CREATE ECOSYSTEMS NETWORKS AND BENEFITS THAT LEAD TO THE KINDS OF CONDITIONS IN THE WORKPLACE IN WHICH
WOMEN ALL WOMEN CAN THRIVE AND PERHAPS FAR MORE BASIC THAN THAT EXPERTS AGREE THAT EMPLOYERS MUST LEAD BY EXAMPLE IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THESE WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE PAST FEW YEARS ONLY BY DOING THIS CAN THEY CREATE THE SUPPORT STRUCTURES NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT NO SINGLE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP FALLS EVEN FURTHER BEHIND SHARE USING EMAIL SHARE ON TWITTER SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON LINKEDIN SHARE RECOMMENDED ARTICLES WHY TRUST IN WOMEN LEADERS IS FALLING WHY TRUST IN WOMEN LEADERS IS FALLING THUMBNAIL THE DARK SIDE OF SELF EMPLOYMENT THE DARK SIDE OF SELF EMPLOYMENT THUMBNAIL THE US PUSH TO MAKE SALARIES PUBLIC WOMAN AT LAPTOP THUMBNAIL EQUALITY MATTERS HOW WE WORK THE WOMEN FORCED TO CHOOSE SELF EMPLOYMENT SHARE USING EMAIL SHARE ON TWITTER SHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON LINKEDIN IMAGE CREDIT IMAGES CREDIT IMAGES BY TWENTY FIFTH OCTOBER IN THE US MORE WOMEN ARE WORKING FOR THEMSELVES ON THE SURFACE IT SEEMS EMPOWERING BUT THERES A DARK NARRATIVE DRIVING THIS RISE IN SELF
