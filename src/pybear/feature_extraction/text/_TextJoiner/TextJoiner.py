    """Join a (possibly ragged) 2D array-like of strings across rows
    with the `sep` character string(s).

    When passed a 2D array-like of strings, `TextJoiner` (TJ) joins each
    row-wise sequence of strings on the value given by `sep` and returns
    a 1D Python list of joined strings in place of the original inner
    containers.

    The `sep` parameter can be passed as a single character string, in
    which case all strings in the data will be joined by that string.
    `sep` can also be passed as a 1D sequence of strings, whose length
    must equal the number of rows of text in the data. In that case, TJ
    uses the string in each position of the 1D sequence to join the
    corresponding row of text in the data.

    TJ is a full-fledged scikit-style transformer. It has fully
    functional `get_params`, `set_params`, `transform`, and `fit_transform`
    methods. It also has `partial_fit`, `fit`, and `score` methods, which
    are no-ops. TJ technically does not need to be fit because it already
    knows everything it needs to do transformations from `sep`. These
    no-op methods are available to fulfill the scikit transformer API
    and make TJ suitable for incorporation into larger workflows, such
    as Pipelines and dask_ml wrappers.

    Because TJ doesn't need any information from :meth:`partial_fit`
    and :meth:`fit`, it is technically always in a 'fitted' state and
    ready to transform data. Checks for fittedness will always return
    True.

    TJ has one attribute, :attr:`n_rows_`, which is only available after
    data has been passed to :meth:`transform`. `n_rows_` is the number
    of rows of text seen in the original data, and must be the number of
    strings in the returned 1D Python list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sep : Optional[Union[str, Sequence[str]]], default=' '
        The character sequence to insert between individual strings when
        joining the 2D input data across rows. If a 1D sequence of
        strings, then the `sep` value in each position is used to join
        the corresponding row in `X`. In that case, the number of entries
        in `sep` must equal the number of rows in `X`.
