    """Fit text as strings to the user-specified number of characters per
    row.

    For this module, the data must be a 1D Python list of strings.

    `_sep` and `_line_break` must have already been processed
    by :func:`_param_conditioner`, i.e., all literal strings must be
    converted to re.compile and any flags passed as parameters or
    associated with `case_sensitive` must have been put in the compile(s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X : list[str]
        The text to justify as a 1D Python list of strings.
    _n_chars : numbers.Integral
        The number of characters per line to target when justifying the
        text.
    _sep : SepWipType
        The regex pattern(s) that indicate to TJ where it is allowed to
        wrap a line.
    _line_break : LineBreakWipType
        The regex pattern(s) that indicate to TJ where it must force a
        new line.
    _backfill_sep : str
        Some lines in the text may not have any of the given wrap
        separators or line breaks at the end of the line. When justifying
        text and there is a shortfall of characters in a line, TJ will
        look to the next line to backfill strings. In the case where the
        line being backfilled onto does not have a separator or line
        break at the end of the string, this character string will
        separate the otherwise separator-less string from the string
        being backfilled onto it.

    Return
    ------
    _X : list[str]
        The justified text in a Python list of strings.
