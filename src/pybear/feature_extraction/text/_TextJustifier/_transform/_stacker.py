    """Compile the text in `X` line by line to fill the `n_chars` per
    row requirement.

    After the original text is split into lines of indivisible chunks of
    text by :func:`_splitter` (each line ends with `sep` or `line_break`,
    or has neither), recompile the text line by line to fill the `n_chars`
    per row requirement. Observe the `line_break` rule that that pattern
    must end a line and subsequent text starts on a new line below.
    Observe the `backfill_sep` rule that when a line that does not end
    with a `sep` pattern has a line from a row below stacked to it, that
    the `backfill_sep` sequence is inserted in between.

    How could a line in the split text have no `sep` or `line_break`
    at the end? Because that was how the line was in the raw text,
    and :func:`_splitter` did a no-op on it because there were no seps
    or line breaks in it.

    `sep` and `line_break` must have already been processed
    by :func:`_param_conditioner`, i.e., all literal strings must be
    converted to re.compile and any flags passed as parameters or
    associated with `case_sensitive` must have been put in the compile(s).

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X : list[str]
        The data as processed by _splitter(). Must be a list of strings.
        Each string is an indivisible unit of text based on the given
        separators and line-breaks.
    _n_chars : numbers.Integral
        The number of characters per line to target when justifying the
        text.
    _sep : SepWipType
        The regex pattern(s) that indicate to TJ where it is allowed to
        wrap a line.
    _line_break : LineBreakWipType
        The regex pattern(s) that indicate to TJ where it must force a
        new line.
    _backfill_sep : str
        Some lines in the text may not have any of the given wrap
        separators or line breaks at the end of the line. When justifying
        text and there is a shortfall of characters in a line, TJ will
        look to the next line to backfill strings. In the case where the
        line being backfilled onto does not have a separator or line
        break at the end of the string, this character string will
        separate the otherwise separator-less string from the string
        being backfilled onto it.

    Returns
    -------
    _X : list[str]
        The data in its final justified state.
