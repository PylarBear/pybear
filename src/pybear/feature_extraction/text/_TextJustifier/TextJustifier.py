    """Justify text as closely as possible to the number of characters
    per line given by the user.

    This is not designed for making final drafts of highly formatted
    business letters. This is a tool designed to turn highly ragged
    text into block form that is more easily ingested and manipulated
    by humans and machines. Consider lines read in from text files or
    scraped from the internet. Many times there is large disparity in
    the number of characters per line, some lines may have a few
    characters, and other lines may have thousands of characters (or
    more.) This tool will square-up the text for you.

    The cleaner your data is, the more powerful this tool is, and
    the more predicable are the results. TextJustifier (TJ) in no
    way is designed to do any cleaning. See the other pybear text
    wrangling modules for that. While TJ will handle any text
    passed to it and blindly apply the instructions given to it,
    results are better when this is used toward the end of a text
    processing workflow. For  best results, pybear recommends that
    removal of junk characters (pybear :class:`TextReplacer`), empty
    strings (pybear :class:`TextRemover`), and leading and trailing
    spaces (pybear :class:`TextStripper`) be done before using TJ.

    There are 3 operative parameters for justifying text in this module,
    `n_chars`, `sep`, and `line_break`. `n_chars` is the target number
    of characters per line. The minimum allowed value is 1, and there is
    no maximum value. The `sep` parameter is the string sequence(s) or
    regex pattern(s) that tell TJ where it is allowed to wrap text. It
    does not mean that TJ WILL wrap that particular text, but that it
    can if it needs to when near the `n_chars` limit on a line. The wrap
    occurs AFTER the `sep` sequence. A common `sep` is a single space.
    The `line_break` parameter is the string sequence(s) or regex
    pattern(s) that tell TJ where it MUST wrap text. When TJ finds a
    `line_break` sequence, it will force a new line. The break occurs
    AFTER the `line_break` sequence. A typical `line_break` might be a
    period.

    When TJ is instantiated, there must be at least one `sep` for TJ
    to wrap on but there do not need to be any specified line breaks.
    This means that `sep` must be passed but `line_break` can be left
    to the default value of None. Both `sep` and `line_break` can accept
    patterns as literal strings or regular expressions. Also, both
    parameters can accept multiple patterns to wrap/break on via 1D
    sequences of patterns.

    To identify wrap points and line breaks using literal strings, pass
    a string or 1D sequence of strings to `sep` and `line_break`. You
    can mix containers to the different parameters, i.e., one could be a
    sequence and the other could be a single string. To identify wrap
    points and line breaks using regex patterns, pass a re.compile
    object with the regex pattern (and flags, if desired) or pass a 1D
    sequence of such objects. DO NOT PASS A REGEX PATTERN AS A LITERAL
    STRING. YOU WILL NOT GET THE CORRECT RESULT. ALWAYS PASS REGEX
    PATTERNS IN A re.compile OBJECT. DO NOT ESCAPE LITERAL STRINGS,
    TextJustifier WILL DO THAT FOR YOU. If you don't know what any of
    that means, then you don't need to worry about it, just use literal
    strings.

    Literal strings and re.compile objects cannot be mixed. You must
    go all-in on literals or all-in on regex. This means that you
    cannot pass 1D lists containing a mix of literals and re.compile
    objects to `sep` and `line_break`. Additionally, whatever wrap-point
    identification method is used in `sep` must be also be used for
    `line_break`. Meaning, if you used re.compile objects to indicate
    wrap points for `sep`, then you must also use re.compile objects to
    indicate break points for `line_break`.

    Literal string mode has validation and protections in place that
    prevent conflicts that could lead to undesired results. These
    safeguards make for a predictable tool. But these safeguards are
    not in place in regex mode. The reason is that the exact behavior
    of literal strings, as opposed to regex, can be predicted before
    ever seeing any text. Conflicts are impossible to predict when using
    regex unless you know the text it is applied to beforehand. No `sep`
    can be a substring of another `sep`. No `sep` can be identical to a
    `line_break` entry and no `sep` can be a substring of a `line_break`.
    No `line_break` can be a substring of another `line_break`. No
    `line_break` can be identical to a `sep` entry and no `line_break`
    can be a substring of a `sep`. But these rules do not apply when
    using regex. In regex mode, a conflict exists when both the `sep`
    pattern and the `line_break` pattern identify the same location in
    text as the first character of a match. In that case, TJ applies
    `sep`. It is up to the user to assess the pitfalls and the likelihood
    of error when using regex on their data. The user should inspect
    their results to ensure the desired outcome.

    TJ searches always default to case-sensitive, but can be made to
    be case-insensitive. You can globally set this behavior via the
    `case_sensitive` parameter. For those of you that know regex, you
    can also put flags in the re.compile objects passed to `sep` and
    `line_break`. Also, flags can be set globally for each of those
    parameters via `sep_flags` and `line_break_flags`, respectfully.
    Case-sensitivity is generally controlled by `case_sensitive` but
    IGNORECASE flags passed via re.compile objects or to the 'flags'
    parameters will ALWAYS overrule `case_sensitive`.

    Some lines in the text may not have any of the given wrap separators
    or line breaks at the end of the line. When justifying text and
    there is a shortfall of characters in a line, TJ will look to the
    next line to backfill strings. In the case where the line being
    backfilled onto does not have a separator at the end of the string,
    the character string given by `backfill_sep` will separate the
    otherwise separator-less string from the string being backfilled
    onto it.

    As simple as the tool is in concept, there are some nuances. Here is
    a non-exhaustive list of some of the quirks that may help the user
    understand some edge cases and explain why TJ returns the things
    that it does.
    1) TJ will not autonomously hyphenate words.
    2) If a line has no wraps or line-breaks in it, then TJ can only do
    2 things with it. If a line is given as longer than `n_chars` and
    there are no places to wrap, TJ will return the line as given,
    regardless of what `n_chars` is set to. But if the line is shorter
    than `n_chars`, it may have text from the next line(s) backfilled
    onto it.
    3) If `n_chars` is set very low, perhaps lower than the length of
    words (tokens) that may normally be encountered, then those
    words/lines will extend beyond the `n_chars` margin. Cool trick: if
    you want an itemized list of all the tokens in your text, set
    `n_chars` to 1.

    TJ accepts 1D and 2D data formats. Accepted objects include Python
    built-in lists, tuples, and sets, numpy arrays, pandas series and
    dataframes, and polars series and dataframes. When data is passed
    in a 1D container, results are always returned as a 1D Python
    list of strings. When data is passed in a 2D container, TJ uses
    pybear :class:`TextJoiner` and the `join_2D` parameter to convert it
    to a 1D list for processing. Then, once the processing is done, TJ
    uses pybear :class:`TextSplitter` and the `join_2D` parameter again
    to convert it back to 2D. The 2D results are always returned in a
    Python list of Python lists of strings. See TextJoiner and
    TextSplitter.

    TJ is a full-fledged scikit-style transformer. It has fully
    functional `get_params`, `set_params`, `transform`, and `fit_transform`
    methods. It also has `partial_fit`, `fit`, and `score` methods, which
    are no-ops. TJ technically does not need to be fit because it already
    knows everything it needs to do transformations from the parameters.
    These no-op methods are available to fulfill the scikit transformer
    API and make TJ suitable for incorporation into larger workflows,
    such as Pipelines and dask_ml wrappers.

    Because TJ doesn't need any information from :meth:`partial_fit`
    and :meth:`fit`, it is technically always in a 'fitted' state and
    ready to transform data. Checks for fittedness will always return
    True.

    TJ has one attribute, :attr:`n_rows_`, which is only available after
    data has been passed to :meth:`transform`. `n_rows_` is the number
    of rows of text seen in the original data. The outputted data may
    not have the same number of rows as the inputted data. This number
    is not cumulative and only reflects that last batch of data passed
    to `transform`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_chars : Optional[numbers.Integral], default=79
        The target number of characters per line when justifying the
        given text. Minimum allowed value is 1; there is no maximum
        value. Under normal expected operation with reasonable margins,
        the outputted text will not exceed this number but can fall
        short. If margins are unusually small, the output can exceed
        the given margins (e.g. the margin is set lower than an
        individual word's length.)
    sep : SepType, default=' '
        The literal string(s) or re.compile object(s) that indicate
        to `TextJustifier` where it is allowed to wrap a line. When
        passed as a 1D sequence, TJ will consider any of those patterns
        as a place where it can wrap a line. If a `sep` pattern is
        in the middle of a sequence that might otherwise be expected
        to be contiguous, TJ will wrap a new line AFTER the `sep`
        indiscriminately if proximity to the `n_chars` limit dictates
        to do so. Cannot be an empty string or a regex pattern that
        blatantly returns zero-span matches. Cannot be an empty sequence.
        When passed as re.compile object(s), it is only validated to be
        an instance of re.Pattern and that it is not likely to return
        zero-span matches. TJ does not assess the validity of the
        expression itself. Any exceptions would be raised by `re.search`.
        See the main docs for more discussion about limitations on what
        can be passed here.
    sep_flags : Optional[Union[numbers.Integral, None]], default=None
        The flags for the `sep` parameter. THIS WILL APPLY EVEN IF YOU
        PASS LITERAL STRINGS TO `sep`. IGNORECASE flags passed to this
        will overrule `case_sensitive` for `sep`. This parameter is only
        validated by TJ to be an instance of numbers.Integral or None.
        TJ does not assess the validity of the value. Any exceptions
        would be raised by `re.search`.
    line_break : LineBreakType, default=None
        Literal string(s) or re.compile object(s) that indicate to TJ
        where it MUST end a line. TJ will start a new line immediately
        AFTER the occurrence of the pattern regardless of the number
        of characters in the line. When passed as a 1D sequence of
        literals or re.compile objects, TJ will start a new line
        immediately after all occurrences of the patterns given. If
        None, do not force any line breaks. If the there are no
        patterns in the data that match the given strings, then there
        are no forced line breaks. If a `line_break` pattern is in the
        middle of a sequence that might otherwise be expected to be
        contiguous, TJ will force a new line after the `line_break`
        indiscriminately. Cannot be an empty string or a regex pattern
        that blatantly returns zero-span matches. Cannot be an empty
        1D sequence. When passed as re.compile object(s), it is only
        validated to be an instance of re.Pattern and that it is not
        likely to return zero-span matches. TJ does not assess the
        validity of the expression itself. Any exceptions would be
        raised by `re.search`. See the main docs for more discussion
        about limitations on what can be passed here.
    line_break_flags : Optional[Union[numbers.Integral, None]], default=None
        The flags for the `line_break` parameter. THIS WILL APPLY EVEN
        IF YOU PASS LITERAL STRINGS TO `line_break`. IGNORECASE flags
        passed to this will overrule `case_sensitive` for `line_break`.
        This parameter is only validated by TJ to be an instance of
        numbers.Integral or None. TJ does not assess the validity of
        the value. Any exceptions would be raised by `re.search`.
    backfill_sep : Optional[str], default=' '
        In the case where a line is shorter than `n_chars`, DOES NOT END
        WITH A WRAP SEPARATOR, and the following line is short enough to
        be merged with it, this character string will separate the two
        strings when merged. If you do not want a separator in this case,
        pass an empty string to this parameter.
    join_2D : Optional[str], default=' '
        Ignored if the data is given as a 1D sequence. For 2D containers
        of strings, this is the character string sequence that is used
        to join the strings within rows to convert the data to 1D for
        processing. The single string value is used to join the strings
        within the rows for all rows in the data.
