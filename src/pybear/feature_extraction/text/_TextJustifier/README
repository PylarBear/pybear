DO NOT TRY TO COMBINE SHARED FROM TextJustifier AND TextJustifierRE
THEY ONLY HAVE 5 FILES IN COMMON
_sep_lb_finder
_backfill_sep
_join_2D
_n_chars
_type_aliases

DO NOT TRY TO MAKE TextJustifierRegExp HANDLE TextJustifier BECAUSE
TextJustifier HAS VALIDATION IN PLACE THAT CANNOT BE DONE WITH REGEX.
