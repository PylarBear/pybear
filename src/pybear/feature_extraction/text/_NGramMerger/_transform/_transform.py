    """Scan over the full dataset looking for patterns that match the
    given ngrams.

    When there is a match, merge the words into a single contiguous
    string mapped from the words.

    Merge ngrams that match ngram patterns using the following hierarchy:

    by the given callable

    by the given separator

    by the default separator

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X : list[list[str]]
        (possibly ragged) 2D array of strings.
    _ngrams : NGramsWipType
        The n-gram sequences to look for in the data. Each individual
        n-gram must be a tuple of re.compile objects that specify an
        n-gram pattern. Cannot be empty, and cannot have any ngrams
        that have less than 2 entries.
    _ngcallable : Union[Callable[[list[str]], str], None]
        The callable applied to sequences that match an n-gram pattern
        to produce a single contiguous string.
    _sep : Union[str, None]
        The user defined separator to join the words with, when
        `_ngcallable` is not given. If no separator is defined by the
        user, use the default separator.
    _wrap : bool
        Whether to look for pattern matches across the end of the
        current line and beginning of the next line.
    _remove_empty_rows : bool
        Whether to delete any empty rows that may occur during the
        merging process. A row could only become empty if `_wrap` is
        True or the original data had an empty row already in it.

    Returns
    -------
    X_tr : tuple[list[list[str]], NDArray[bool]]
        list[list[str]] - the data with all matching n-gram patterns
        replaced with contiguous strings.

        NDArray[bool] - a 1D boolean vector of shape (n_rows_, ) that
        indicates what rows of the data were kept (True) and what rows
        were removed (False) during transform. A row can only be removed
        from the data if `_wrap` is True.
