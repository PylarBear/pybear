    """Create 2 separate lists of indices.

    Can only access this module if there was a match in the wrap region.
    The first list contains the indices in the ORIGINAL first line where
    the pattern match partially overlays. The second list contain the
    indices in the ORIGINAL second line where the match partially
    overlays. Need to know these things to mutate the original lines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _first_line : Sequence[str]
        The active line in transform that is being searched for n-grams.
    _start_idx : numbers.Integral
        The index in the first line where the wrap region started. Python
        range rules apply.
    _end_idx : numbers.Integral
        The index in the second line where the wrap region ended. Python
        range rules apply.
    _wrap_match_idx : Sequence[numbers.Integral]
        The index in the wrap region object where an n-gram pattern match
        started. cannot be empty if this module is accessed.
    _n_len : numbers.Integral
        The length of the n-gram pattern that is currently being searched
        for in transform.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : tuple[list[int], list[int]]
        The indices in the original first line and original second line
        where the pattern match overlays.
