    Apply any flags from 'case_sensitive' and 'flags' to all the compile

    Parameters
    ----------
    _ngrams : Union[Sequence[Sequence[Union[str, re.Pattern[str]]]], None]
        A sequence of sequences, where each inner sequence holds a series
        of string literals and/or re.compile objects that specify an
        n-gram. Cannot be empty, and cannot have any n-grams with less
        than 2 entries. Can be None.
    _case_sensitive : bool
        Whether to do a case-sensitive search.
    _flags : Union[numbers.Integral, None]
        The global flags value(s) applied to the n-gram search. Must be
        None or an integer.

    Returns
    -------
    _wip_ngrams : Union[None, list[tuple[re.Pattern[str], ...]]]
        The ngrams with any literal strings converted to re.compile and
        any flags from 'case_sensitive' and 'flags' applied to the
        compile objects.
