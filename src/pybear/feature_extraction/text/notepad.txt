Trump’s retribution sends a chilling message to dissenters
Zachary B. Wolf
Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf, CNN

CNN  —

Donald Trump’s White House has a threatening message for anyone who might even be perceived to disagree with the president: Don’t. Or else.

Even though he has promised to end what he viewed as “weaponization” of the Department of Justice, Trump is treating people who disagree with him more like the “enemy from within” he talked about during the presidential campaign.

The president took the unusual step this week of issuing official proclamations ordering the federal investigations of people who worked in his first administration.

He’s demanding free work from law firms who represented his perceived enemies, threatening to impeach judges, deporting campus protesters and so much more.

The underlying message, for anyone who hasn’t put all these things together, is that dissent will not be tolerated under Trump 2.0.
To official who said 2020 was a secure election: You’re under investigation

Chris Krebs oversaw the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, during Trump’s first term and affirmed the election Trump lost was free of fraud or tampering.

That’s exactly why Trump wants him investigated. As Trump puts it in the proclamation, Krebs “falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.” There is still zero compelling evidence the 2020 election was rigged or stolen, but the effect on Krebs’ cybersecurity business could be real. And the message to anyone currently working to secure American elections is unmistakable: There will be consequences for crossing the president, even when the president is alleging election fraud that does not exist.
Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, gives an opening statement during a hearing to discuss election security and the 2020 election process on December 16, 2020, in Washington, DC.

To the face of first-term ‘resistance’: You’re guilty of treason

The other individual Trump targeted with a proclamation is Miles Taylor, the former Homeland Security official who wrote, first anonymously, during Trump’s first term that there was a “resistance” among government officials working to mute the president’s impact.

Read CNN’s full report.

Trump did not cite any specific law either man might have broken, but he did say in the Oval Office he thinks Taylor is guilty of treason.

“He’s using every public and private means to try to attack these people, humiliate these people, get them to come and kiss the ring,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jamie Raskin in a video posted to social media.

Trump is taking no chances with a resistance effort during his second term. His layoffs of federal workers, gutting of entire agencies and punitive firings should be message enough.

Key officials, notably, have resigned in key moments rather than follow directives they disagreed with.
To law firms that opposed Trump: Pony up

In the Oval Office, as he signed those proclamations targeting Krebs and Taylor, Trump bragged that law firms who represented his opponents are now lining up to do free work on his behalf after he threatened them with retribution in executive orders.

His aide Stephen Miller said firms have agreed to nearly $700 million in free work for Trump to avoid punitive proclamations. Some law firms, notably Jenner & Block, sued over Trump’s efforts to punish them. A judge said the orders were likely unconstitutional, but many other firms are bending the knee and agreeing to do free work on Trump’s behalf instead.

There are multiple other examples of Trump using the weight of the government to target people and places he opposes.

To cities that don’t want to comply with ICE moves: Federal offices will be closed

Small Business Administration Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced the closure of multiple offices in cities “that do not comply” with ICE efforts and relocate them elsewhere. The targeted cities are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, New York City and Seattle.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy did not mention immigration policy when he announced in a New York Post Op-Ed that HHS would close half of its 10 regional offices. But the targeted offices are a similar list: Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle. Atlanta will keep its regional HHS office, along with Kansas City, Dallas, Denver and Philadelphia.
To universities struggling to balance free speech: Research grants are frozen

Cornell and Northwestern joined a growing list of elite research universities that have had hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in research grants frozen. The administration has demanded that schools end diversity programs and has criticized student protests against the war in Gaza.

To lawful immigrants and students who led campus protests: We’ll deport you

CNN has identified hundreds of students whose visas have been revoked, but the most notable example of a protester targeted for deportation is Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who has been detained in Louisiana for more than a month. A Louisiana immigration judge ruled Friday that Khalil can be deported, although that likely won’t happen immediately since there is also an ongoing case in New Jersey. Khalil was arrested in New York, not Louisiana, and CNN has reported that immigrant rights advocates fear the administration is effectively shopping for judges by moving detainees like Khalil from the Northeast to the South.

To judges who might rule against the administration: We’ll move to impeach you

Republicans in the House do not appear to have the votes, but Trump and Musk have publicly called for judges who issue rulings they disagree with to be impeached. Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare rebuke of that language. The House did have the votes this week to pass a bill aimed at restricting district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions against Trump’s policies, but it faces an uncertain future in the Senate.
To the DOJ lawyer who admitted a man was deported in error: You’re suspended

The Supreme Court said this week that Trump’s administration must facilitate the return of a Maryland father who a Department of Justice lawyer admitted in court was mistakenly deported. The lawyer who made the admission has been suspended, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“He shouldn’t have argued it, if that’s what he was going to do,” she said on Fox News.

All of this will have an effect across the country as people who disagree with Trump struggle to figure out how to register their opposition.

CNN’s Michael Williams went to a protest supporting immigrants in Dallas and heard one organizer say that people who take part need to be prepared to be deported.

“As organizers who feel compelled to protest in this day, we have to accept we may be subject to removal,” Jaclyn McJunkin, an immigration-rights organizer and activist, told the group of about 50 people, according to Williams’ report. “It’s just something that you have to embrace, OK?

CNN  —

Electronics imported to the United States will be exempt from President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, according to a US Customs and Border Protection notice posted late Friday.

Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. The exemption applies to products entering the United States or removed from warehouses as early as April 5, according to the notice.

The exemption, which comes after the Trump administration on Wednesday imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods imported to the United States, does not include the 20% tariff on Chinese goods for the country’s role in the fentanyl trade. The tariff exemption would have a major impact on tech giants like Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China.

Roughly 90% of Apple’s iPhone production and assembly is based in China, according to Wedbush Securities’ estimates.

Analysts at Wedbush on Saturday called the tariff exclusion, “the best news possible for tech investors.”

“Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,” Wedbush said in a statement. “A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend…now onto the next step in negotiations on the broader China tariff war which will take a number of months at least.”

Nvidia and Microsoft declined to comment to CNN. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Counterpoint Research, a firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimated Apple has up to six weeks of inventory in the United States. Once that supply runs out, prices would have been expected to go up.

The White House said on Saturday that Trump will continue to urge tech companies to move production to the United States.

“President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops. That’s why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and Nvidia. At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

Trump had told reporters Friday on Air Force One that there could be possible exclusions to his sweeping tariffs.

“There could be a couple of exceptions for obvious reasons, but I would say 10% is a floor,” Trump said.

Economists have warned the cost of tariffs may ultimately be passed on to the consumer. That fear has sent many Americans rushing to buy big-ticket items, such as cars and electronics, as consumer sentiment has dropped to record lows.

Nintendo said on April 4 that it would postpone the US preorder date of its Switch 2 gaming console to “assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Initially priced at $450, the Switch 2 could instead cost around $600 as a result of tariffs, according to experts.

The Trump administration says these tariffs would bring more manufacturing jobs to the United States and reverse a decades-long decline. But some products can’t be easily made or found in the United States, thus increasing the costs to produce them in American factories.

Semiconductors and microchips are among the products heavily outsourced to factories in Asia due to lower costs. Those electronic parts are now exempt, according to the Friday notice. That could help Asian chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix.

“The president has stated that autos, steel, pharmaceuticals, chips and other specific materials will be included in specific tariffs to ensure tariffs are applied fairly and effectively,” a White House official said.

The official said Trump would soon order a study on the national security effects on semiconductor imports — known as a Section 232 study.

At a Republican National Congressional Committee event on Tuesday, Trump criticized the Biden administration’s decision to award a $6.6 billion grant to TSMC for semiconductor production in Phoenix as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Trump said he gave TSMC no money and told the company “if you don’t build your plant here, you’re going to pay a big tax — 25, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100%.”

CNN’s Kevin Liptak and Lisa Eadicicco contributed to this report.

Trump’s retribution sends a chilling message to dissenters

CNN  —

Donald Trump’s White House has a threatening message for anyone who might even be perceived to disagree with the president: Don’t. Or else.

Even though he has promised to end what he viewed as “weaponization” of the Department of Justice, Trump is treating people who disagree with him more like the “enemy from within” he talked about during the presidential campaign.

The president took the unusual step this week of issuing official proclamations ordering the federal investigations of people who worked in his first administration.

He’s demanding free work from law firms who represented his perceived enemies, threatening to impeach judges, deporting campus protesters and so much more.

The underlying message, for anyone who hasn’t put all these things together, is that dissent will not be tolerated under Trump 2.0.
To official who said 2020 was a secure election: You’re under investigation

Chris Krebs oversaw the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, during Trump’s first term and affirmed the election Trump lost was free of fraud or tampering.

That’s exactly why Trump wants him investigated. As Trump puts it in the proclamation, Krebs “falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.” There is still zero compelling evidence the 2020 election was rigged or stolen, but the effect on Krebs’ cybersecurity business could be real. And the message to anyone currently working to secure American elections is unmistakable: There will be consequences for crossing the president, even when the president is alleging election fraud that does not exist.

To the face of first-term ‘resistance’: You’re guilty of treason

The other individual Trump targeted with a proclamation is Miles Taylor, the former Homeland Security official who wrote, first anonymously, during Trump’s first term that there was a “resistance” among government officials working to mute the president’s impact.

Read CNN’s full report.

Trump did not cite any specific law either man might have broken, but he did say in the Oval Office he thinks Taylor is guilty of treason.

“He’s using every public and private means to try to attack these people, humiliate these people, get them to come and kiss the ring,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jamie Raskin in a video posted to social media.

Trump is taking no chances with a resistance effort during his second term. His layoffs of federal workers, gutting of entire agencies and punitive firings should be message enough.

Key officials, notably, have resigned in key moments rather than follow directives they disagreed with.
To law firms that opposed Trump: Pony up

In the Oval Office, as he signed those proclamations targeting Krebs and Taylor, Trump bragged that law firms who represented his opponents are now lining up to do free work on his behalf after he threatened them with retribution in executive orders.

His aide Stephen Miller said firms have agreed to nearly $700 million in free work for Trump to avoid punitive proclamations. Some law firms, notably Jenner & Block, sued over Trump’s efforts to punish them. A judge said the orders were likely unconstitutional, but many other firms are bending the knee and agreeing to do free work on Trump’s behalf instead.

There are multiple other examples of Trump using the weight of the government to target people and places he opposes.

To cities that don’t want to comply with ICE moves: Federal offices will be closed

Small Business Administration Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced the closure of multiple offices in cities “that do not comply” with ICE efforts and relocate them elsewhere. The targeted cities are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, New York City and Seattle.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy did not mention immigration policy when he announced in a New York Post Op-Ed that HHS would close half of its 10 regional offices. But the targeted offices are a similar list: Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Seattle. Atlanta will keep its regional HHS office, along with Kansas City, Dallas, Denver and Philadelphia.
To universities struggling to balance free speech: Research grants are frozen

Cornell and Northwestern joined a growing list of elite research universities that have had hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in research grants frozen. The administration has demanded that schools end diversity programs and has criticized student protests against the war in Gaza.

To lawful immigrants and students who led campus protests: We’ll deport you

CNN has identified hundreds of students whose visas have been revoked, but the most notable example of a protester targeted for deportation is Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who has been detained in Louisiana for more than a month. A Louisiana immigration judge ruled Friday that Khalil can be deported, although that likely won’t happen immediately since there is also an ongoing case in New Jersey. Khalil was arrested in New York, not Louisiana, and CNN has reported that immigrant rights advocates fear the administration is effectively shopping for judges by moving detainees like Khalil from the Northeast to the South.

To judges who might rule against the administration: We’ll move to impeach you

Republicans in the House do not appear to have the votes, but Trump and Musk have publicly called for judges who issue rulings they disagree with to be impeached. Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare rebuke of that language. The House did have the votes this week to pass a bill aimed at restricting district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions against Trump’s policies, but it faces an uncertain future in the Senate.
To the DOJ lawyer who admitted a man was deported in error: You’re suspended

The Supreme Court said this week that Trump’s administration must facilitate the return of a Maryland father who a Department of Justice lawyer admitted in court was mistakenly deported. The lawyer who made the admission has been suspended, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

“He shouldn’t have argued it, if that’s what he was going to do,” she said on Fox News.

All of this will have an effect across the country as people who disagree with Trump struggle to figure out how to register their opposition.

CNN’s Michael Williams went to a protest supporting immigrants in Dallas and heard one organizer say that people who take part need to be prepared to be deported.

“As organizers who feel compelled to protest in this day, we have to accept we may be subject to removal,” Jaclyn McJunkin, an immigration-rights organizer and activist, told the group of about 50 people, according to Williams’ report. “It’s just something that you have to embrace, OK? Because if you don’t, then they win, right?”

What we're covering

• Trump’s tariffs: President Donald Trump’s trade war with China is deepening, while the clock ticks on a 90-day pause to negotiate complex trade deals with dozens of other countries he has threatened with steep tariffs. A new exemption for imported electronics, including phones and computers, could be a boon for US tech giants like Apple.

• Iran talks: US and Iranian officials began high-stakes talks today in Oman, aimed at negotiating a nuclear deal that could ease tensions in the Middle East. Each side described the initial discussion as “constructive” and agreed to meet again next weekend.

• Immigration crackdown: Legal battles continue surrounding the case of a mistakenly deported Maryland man and the effort to deport a Columbia University graduate known for his pro-Palestinian activism. Trump officials are also cutting off benefits for immigrants who previously received Social Security numbers to work in the US.

White House casts Iran talks as "positive and constructive"

The White House is characterizing today’s nuclear talks between a top Trump adviser and Iran’s foreign minister as a step in the right direction and has confirmed plans for follow-up talks next week.

The “direct communication” between President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was “very positive and constructive,” the White House said in a statement.

Witkoff “underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations’ differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,” the statement said, calling the talks a “step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.”

The US statement thanked Oman for its mediating role in the talks, and noted that the US ambassador to Oman, Ana Escrogima, was also present.

The White House said the two sides plan meet again next Saturday.

In comments reported by Iranian media earlier today, Tehran similarly described the talks as “constructive” and shared the plans for more discussions next week.

Remember: The high-stakes talks come after Trump threatened military strikes against Iran if it did not agree to a new deal, which prompted a warning from Tehran that any attack would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.

Trump has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to Iran shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.
White House says it's still focused on moving tech production to US after announcing tariff exemptions

After exempting several high-tech products from steep new tariffs, the White House says President Donald Trump continues to urge firms to move production to the United States.

“President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops. That’s why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, TSMC, and Nvidia. At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

US Customs and Border Protection posted a notice last night saying smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. That could be huge news for US tech giants like Apple, which bases an estimated 90% of its iPhone production and assembly in China.

“The President has stated that autos, steel, pharmaceuticals, chips and other specific materials will be included in specific tariffs to ensure tariffs are applied fairly and effectively,” a White House official said.

The official said Trump would soon order up a study on the national security effects on semiconductor imports.
Top FEMA officials among dozens of staffers given lie detector tests over alleged leaks at DHS

The Department of Homeland Security has administered lie detector tests to about 50 staffers in recent weeks, including FEMA’s acting administrator and roughly a dozen officials at the disaster relief agency, as part of an intensifying effort to root out what the department alleges are leaks of national security information.

At least one FEMA official has been placed on administrative leave and was escorted out of the agency’s office this week after being administered a polygraph test, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

“We are agnostic about your standing, tenure, political appointment, or status as a career civil servant — we will track down leakers and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to CNN.

The investigations at DHS have raised concerns that the lie detector tests may be used on federal workers accused of leaking non-classified information to the media, particularly at FEMA, where sources say classified information is handled in very limited circumstances.

Whistleblower support organizations tell CNN it would be unusual, alarming and potentially illegal for the tests to be used in such cases.

Second round of US-Iran talks will be held next Saturday, Iranian foreign minister says
From CNN’s Alireza Hajihosseini and Abbas Al Lawati

The second round of nuclear talks between Iranian and American negotiators will be held next Saturday in Oman, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media, adding that today’s meeting “got very close” to reaching a framework for negotiations.

“The atmosphere in today’s meeting was such that it ensured continuity and progress,” Araghchi told state broadcaster IRIB. “If we can finalize the basis (of talks) in the next session, I believe we will have made significant progress.”

He added that both sides said they are seeking an agreement in the shortest time possible.

Araghchi was asked about his brief meeting with US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, which was the first direct contact between US and Iranian officials during Trump’s second term.

“When both parties were leaving, we spent a few minutes conversing,” the foreign minister said. “This is an accepted norm. We always adhere to diplomatic norms when dealing with US diplomats and this time we also exchanged the same level of pleasantries.”

CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
Trump plans to attend "Les Misérables" at Kennedy Center as his administration overhauls the DC institution

Richard Grenell, the controversial interim president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, says President Donald Trump will attend the opening of “Les Misérables” in June and host a fundraiser at the venue.

Grenell is touting Trump’s overhaul of the center, saying in an interview this morning that the president’s purge of the cultural institution’s board and targeting of programming the administration deems unsuitable is saving money.

“We’ve done a hiring freeze, we’ve fired a lot of the bloat, and we’ve saved about $6.2 million in eight weeks already,” Grenell claimed during a “Fox & Friends” appearance. “Donald Trump is coming to the opening of ‘Les Mis’ on June 11. He’s doing a fundraiser for the Kennedy Center. We expect to raise millions for that. So, he personally is turning this around.”

Grennell added that Trump has tasked him with going to Capitol Hill to speak with senators about how to “turn around” the Kennedy Center.

“First of all, we got to get more donors. We got to get — everyone needs to be included. We don’t need to be booing Republicans, like if the vice president shows up,” he said, referring to a recent visit from Vice President JD Vance and his wife Usha in which attendees could be heard booing them.
First round of US-Iran talks ends with plans to reconvene next week, Iranian state media says
From CNN’s Abbas Al Lawati

Delegations from Iran and the United States will meet again next week after wrapping up “constructive” nuclear talks that included the first direct contact between Trump administration and Iranian officials, according to Iran’s state news agency.

The two sides shared their views on Iran’s nuclear program and the potential lifting of sanctions against the Islamic Republic through Omani Foreign Minister Badr Al Busaidi, “in a constructive atmosphere based on mutual respect,” according to the report from state-run IRNA.

“After more than two and a half hours of indirect negotiations, the heads of the Iranian and American delegations spoke for a few minutes in the presence of the Omani foreign minister as they left the talks,” IRNA added.

CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.

Oman’s foreign minister said on X that he was proud to facilitate the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, which were aimed at reaching a “fair and binding” agreement.

Remember: Today’s high-stakes talks are aimed at securing a potential new nuclear deal between the two countries and easing tensions in the region.

The talks came in the wake of President Donald Trump’s threat of military strikes if Iran fails to agree to a pact — and Tehran’s warning that any attack would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.

Trump has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to Iran shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.

Electronics including phones and computers imported to the United States will be exempt from President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, according to a US Customs and Border Protection notice posted yesterday.

Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. The exemption applies to products entering the US or removed from warehouses as early as April 5, according to the notice.

The move comes after the Trump administration imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods. The tariffs would have a major impact on tech giants like Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China.

Roughly 90% of Apple’s iPhone production and assembly is based in China, according to Wedbush Securities’ estimates.

Trump had told reporters yesterday on Air Force One that there could be possible exclusions to his sweeping tariffs.

The White House has not responded to a CNN request for comment.

Florida universities join statewide push to partner with ICE on immigration enforcement

Several universities in Florida have signed agreements to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of an ongoing push by state leaders to aid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The University of Florida confirmed yesterday it has signed an agreement that allows local law enforcement to act as immigration officers.

The arrangements, known as 287(g) agreements, allow local officers to question those they suspect of being in the country illegally and to execute arrest warrants for immigration violations, according to a statement from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in February.

The University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida have also signed the pacts with ICE, according to CNN affiliate WFTV.

CNN reached out to Florida International University and Florida Atlantic University about news reports that their campus police have done the same.

The prospect of increased immigration enforcement could cause additional friction on the University of Florida campus. On Wednesday, crowds gathered there to protest the deportation of a Colombian student, according to CNN affiliate WCJB.

The big picture: By CNN’s count, more than 500 students, faculty and researchers across the US have had their visas revoked this year, including at least four University of Florida students.

An increasing number of student deportation threats involve the revocation of visas based on relatively minor offenses like years-old misdemeanors.
US tariffs could "trigger a humanitarian crisis," China tells World Trade Organization
From CNN’s Anna Cooban, Martha Zhou and Billy Stockwell

China warned yesterday that the United States’ tariffs could spark a “humanitarian crisis,” as the world’s two largest economies continue their tit-for-tat in US President Donald Trump’s trade war.

“The United States’ ‘reciprocal tariffs’ will inflict great harm on developing countries, especially the least developed countries, and even trigger a humanitarian crisis,” Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said during a Friday video call with the director-general of the World Trade Organization.

In a statement by the ministry today, Wang said Trump’s tariffs have “brought great uncertainty and instability to the world.”

The statement said Wang stressed to WTO members that they should stand firm against “unilateralism, protectionism and bullying.”

Another US rival weighs in on trade: Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said today that the WTO has been “paralyzed” by successive American administrations and that tariff deals must now be struck fairly.

“The tariff war which we witness now is going to change many things. We hear that many countries would like to sit down with the United States and negotiate,” Lavrov said during an address at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey.

“We would only be happy if people reach some deals peacefully and to their mutual satisfaction,” he said.
Reporting roundup: CNN's latest stories on the Trump administration

Welcome to today’s live coverage of President Donald Trump’s administration.

We’ll be tracking developments on the president’s trade war and the high-stakes US-Iran talks taking place in Oman.

Click on the links below for more of CNN’s latest reporting on other key topics:

• Daughter challenges ICE arrest of her mom: To Karen Cruz Berrios, her mother is a hard-working, devoted single parent. But the Department of Homeland Security has alleged, without providing evidence, she is “an associate of the vicious MS-13 gang.”

• Anti-DEI push at Pentagon-run schools: Recent Pentagon policies are having direct impacts on students at Defense Department-run schools around the globe, with kids and their parents telling CNN they fear they’re now at a disadvantage.

• Tariffs clobber the toy industry: Toys made in China are no longer exempt from US tariffs. For American families, this means relatively inexpensive toys could become luxuries.

• Shrinking consumer protection agency: A federal appeals court will allow the Trump administration to further shrink the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — but not dismantle it entirely.

• RFK Jr. and the measles vaccine: Trump’s health and human services secretary made his strongest endorsement yet of the measles vaccine this week amid an ongoing outbreak. But that stands in stark contrast to years of his work against the vaccine.

• US military at the southern border: Trump instructed the heads of four federal agencies last night to let the military “take a more direct role” in efforts to secure the border.

The US and Iran are beginning critical nuclear talks today as Trump threatens war
From CNN's Abbas Al Lawati, Alex Marquardt and Kylie Atwood

Iran and the United States begin high-stakes talks to reach a new nuclear deal today.

This comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s threat of military strikes if Iran fails to agree to a pact — and Tehran’s warning that any attack would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.

The meeting, being held in the Gulf Arab nation of Oman, could be the first direct talks between Iranian and American officials in a decade, though Iran insists they will be indirect, with mediators acting as go-betweens for the two nations.

Trump has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to Iran shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.

“I want them not to have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country, but they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida last night.

What we’ve heard so far today: Iran is seeking an “initial understanding” with the US that could lead to a negotiations process, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation to the talks, said upon arriving in the Omani capital Muscat.

It’s “too early” to speak about a timetable for the discussions, which depends on “sufficient will on both sides,” he said.

An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said indirect talks are underway, with plans for the parties to be seated in separate rooms and convey their views to each other through the Omani foreign minister.

The atmosphere in the talks is positive, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, citing a member of the negotiating team. It added that negotiations are unlikely to be extended into Sunday.

CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.

Trump has 90 days to do 150 trade deals. Here's where things stand after a rollercoaster week
From CNN's David Goldman and John Towfighi
President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday.
President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Friday.

President Donald Trump and his advisers claim this was the plan all along: Announce astronomically high tariffs, get countries to come to the negotiating table, and — with the exception of China — then back off in order to work out new trade agreements.

But Trump’s 90-day pause on his “reciprocal” tariffs gives the administration just three months to strike enormously complex trade deals with dozens of countries.

Financial markets aren’t buying it. Stocks have whipsawed as volatility has spiked. And other markets are sending a clear message of deep skepticism that Trump will be able to pull this one off.

Where things left off Friday: Following another steep sell-off Thursday, stocks appeared calmer — for now — and posted strong gains Friday.

The Dow ended the day higher by 619 points, or 1.56%. The S&P 500 rose 1.81% and the Nasdaq was 2.06% higher.

But warning signs continued flashing from other markets, including oil, bonds and the dollar. And investors have been trading on a knife’s edge, with any announcement from Trump liable to send stocks surging or tumbling.

What comes next: The Trump administration is voicing optimism, saying dozens of countries have reached out to strike a deal. The administration is providing few details on any ongoing talks, but has said it will favor allies like South Korea and Japan first.

But trade deals are incredibly complex arrangements usually negotiated over the course of years, not months.

China looms: Even if Trump struck deals with all those countries over a short period, China — the world’s biggest exporter — remains the elephant in the room.

Beijing is locked in a tit-for-tat battle with Washington, with Trump not only excluding China from his tariff pause but also raising tariffs on the country to at least 145%.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping said he is “not afraid” in his first public comments on the escalating trade war, and has raised tariffs on US goods to 125%.

Nick Dunlap records extraordinary 19-shot turnaround after nightmarish opening round at the Masters
By Issy Ronald, CNN
2 minute read
Updated 2:27 PM EDT, Sat April 12, 2025

CNN  —

What do you do after recording one of the worst first-round scores ever at the Masters? Nick Dunlap had no hope of making the cut after shooting an 18-over-par 90 on Thursday. He briefly thought about quitting the tournament. He hit dozens of balls into the woods behind his Airbnb.

And then, somehow, the 21-year-old American delivered a near-historic turnaround on Friday, improving his score by 19 shots to finish one-under-par in the second round.

Though he missed the cut and finished 17-over across the two days, such an improvement was the biggest round-to-round turnaround at the Masters since 1936, and joint-biggest in any major in the past 50 years, according to ESPN.

Dunlap, who is considered one of the sport’s hottest prospects after his achievements as a junior rivalled those of Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods, was still left disappointed and frustrated after his tournament.

“(There’s) about the same (emotions as last round),” he told reporters afterward.

“It’s frustrating. There’s a lot of anger. It’s hard to put everything you have into something and feel like you’re not getting any better. But, yeah, show up today, gave it all I got and posted something under par.”

Despite recording a round under par, Dunlap’s struggles haven’t magically disappeared. He still visibly struggled with his driver, mostly choosing to use a 3-wood off the tee on Friday, compromising distance for accuracy.

Still, he managed to hit four birdies and avoid any bogeys until late on when he bogied the 16th, 17th and 18th holes.

“I had more of a knot in my stomach today than I’ve ever had starting a round of golf, he said. “So, I definitely can learn something from that, but it’s not a position that I ever want to be in again.”

Problems have crept into Dunlap’s game since the Hero World Challenge in December, he said, and “continually gotten worse.”

Although he won two PGA Tour titles last season, including the first win by an amateur since 1991, he has failed to make the cut at his first six majors since turning professional.

The dizzying highs and lows of his career so far have been “extremely rewarding and extremely humbling and frustrating at the same time,” he said.

“I think professional golf is a very – can be a very lonely place, especially when you’re playing poorly. But it’s been a lot of fun. You get to travel to a lot of historic and unbelievable places like this one.”

He will next play at RBC Heritage on April 17.

Ken Griffey Jr., a 13-time MLB All-Star, is taking his talents to the Masters this week, stepping up to a different kind of green and view. Griffey is a credentialed photographer for Masters.com.

After playing the course a few years back, he said, “I am not going to go to a Masters until I play it and now I have the opportunity to shoot it. It’s been unbelievable and wild,” telling Mornings at the Masters.

Since his retirement in 2010, he picked up the lens in 2015 and hasn’t put it down since. He has been credentialed to shoot MLB, MLS, NFL and IndyCar events. Augusta National Golf Club is where history is made and firsts happen for many — just like Griffey Jr.

He picked up a camera not only for the love of sports, but he said, “it was actually the only way I could see my kids.” Relating to his dad, “I understand what he felt like coming to watch me play.”

As a public figure, and with social media creating buzz at any time, this factors into his everyday life. When he was going to watch his kids’ games, people would come up to him and distract him.

Griffey said, “My daughter literally stopped dribbling a basketball and just looked at me when she was five. I was like okay, I’ve got to pay more attention to what’s going on. I figured no one’s messing with the photographer, well let me pick it up, let me try it.”

April 10 is a lucky and special day for the Griffey family. With his dad’s birthday today, Ken would always do an “easy birthday gift” for his dad.

His first home run was on April 10, 1989, his 400th on April 10, 2000, and now he is a credentialed photographer for one of the most prestigious golf tournaments in the world.

Don’t worry, hitting a home run is still better for this All-Star, but a 330-yard drive might come close for Griffey Jr.

The Masters will continue throughout the weekend. The iconic green jacket will be given out on Sunday, and Griffey Jr. will be there to capture those special moments.

Nikola Jokić becomes third player in NBA history to average triple-double for the season

Nikola Jokić became the third player in NBA history to average a triple-double for the season on Friday night, as the Denver Nuggets rallied late to claim a 117-109 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.

The three-time NBA MVP put up 26 points, 16 rebounds and 12 assists, the fourth of which was his 700th of the season, guaranteeing that he will average double figures for assists for the first time in his career.

Jokić’s teammate, Russell Westbrook, is one of the other two players to have achieved the extraordinary feat, having done so four times – in 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and in 2020-21 with the Washington Wizards.

Oscar Robertson, who averaged 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists in 1961-62 with the Cincinnati Royals, is the other.

Despite joining such illustrious company, Jokić appeared relatively indifferent to the achievement.

“It’s nice. I didn’t do that before,” he said afterwards. “I don’t know what to say. It’s good.”

The Serbian’s triple-double on Friday night was his 34th of the season. Westbrook and Robertson are the only players ever to have recorded more, the former on two occasions.

Remarkably, Jokić has put up 23 more triple-doubles than Giannis Antetokounmpo, who has the second-most in the league this season with 11.

Despite also averaging a career-best in scoring, three-pointers made and three-point percentage, Jokić looks likely to miss out on MVP honors, with the Thunder’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander the strong favorite.

“If he doesn’t win the MVP, it’s the greatest season of all time not to win the MVP,” Nuggets interim head coach David Adelman said of Jokić.

Down by five in the fourth quarter against the Grizzlies on Friday, Denver went on an impressive 14-1 run in the final six minutes to give Adelman his second win in as many games at the helm.
Huge scorelines across NBA set new record

Elsewhere in the NBA, five games were decided by 30 or more points on Friday, the first time in league history that so many matchups have been settled by such a margin on one day, according to AP.

The Boston Celtics were one of the teams to stroll to victory, beating the Charlotte Hornets 130-94 thanks to 22 points from Payton Pritchard and 20 from Sam Hauser. The victory meant that the Celtics have 60 wins in a season for the 15th time in franchise history, an NBA record.

Luka Dončić continued his excellent run, recording 39 points, eight rebounds and seven assists as the Los Angeles Lakers thrashed the Houston Rockets 140-109 to clinch the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference.

The Miami Heat, the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Chicago Bulls were the other three teams to win by 30 points or more.
