):
    """Remove stop words from text data.

    StopRemover (SR) uses the stop words defined in the pybear `Lexicon`
    `stop_words_` attribute to locate and remove stop words from a 2D
    array-like body of text data.

    pybear wants to deliver a robust and predictable output for your
    inputs, and recommends that SR should only be used on highly
    processed data. SR should not be the first (or even near the first)
    step in a complex text wrangling workflow. This should be one of the
    last steps. An example of the last steps of a workflow using pybear
    text wrangling modules could be:

    ... > TextLookup > StopRemover > NGramMerger > TextJustifier.

    To this end, SR only accepts tokenized text in 2D array-like format.
    Trying to manage the contingencies of replacing stop words vis-a-vis
    individual user preferences concerning adjoining characters and the
    impact on white space in long text strings as would be in 1D format
    is intractable. Therefore, pybear pushes back to the user to require
    that the data be processed at least to the point where you know what
    your separators are and you are able to split your data into tokens.
    If you have 1D data and know what your separators are as either
    string literal or regex patterns, use pybear :class:`TextSplitter`
    to convert your data to 2D before using SR. Accepted 2D objects
    include Python list/tuple of lists/tuples, numpy arrays, pandas
    dataframes, and polars dataframes. Results are always returned as a
    Python list of lists of strings.

    The default text comparer in SR does a case-insensitive, exact
    character-to-character match of each token in the text body against
    the stop words, and removes a word from the text when there is a
    match. If you want to override the default SR case-insensitive
    behavior, pass a new callable to the `match_callable` parameter.
    The callable can take anything that you can put into a callable, as
    long as the signature is [str, str] and returns a boolean. If you
    would like to do your stop word matching with regular expressions,
    then by all means put that in your callable.

    Optionally, you can instruct SR to remove any empty rows that may
    be left after the stop word removal process. After transform, SR
    exposes the :attr:`row_support_` attribute which is a boolean vector
    that shows which rows in the data were kept (True) and which ones
    were removed (False). The only way an entry in this vector could
    become False is if the `remove_empty_rows` parameter is True and a
    row became empty during the stop word removal process. `row_support_`
    only reflects the last dataset passed to transform.

    SR is a full-fledged scikit-style transformer. It has fully
    functional `get_params`, `set_params`, `transform`, and `fit_transform`
    methods. It also has `partial_fit`, `fit`, and `score` methods, which
    are no-ops. SR technically does not need to be fit because it already
    knows everything it needs to do transformations from the parameters
    and the stop words in the pybear `Lexicon`. These no-op methods are
    available to fulfill the scikit transformer API and make SR suitable
    for incorporation into larger workflows, such as Pipelines and
    dask_ml wrappers.

    Because SR doesn't need any information from :meth:`partial_fit`
    and :meth:`fit`, it is technically always in a 'fitted' state and
    ready to transform data. Checks for fittedness will always return
    True.

    SR has an :attr:`n_rows_` attribute which is only available after
    data has been passed to :meth:`transform`. `n_rows_` is the number
    of rows of text seen in the original data, and must match the number
    of entries in `row_support_`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    match_callable : Optional[Union[Callable[[str, str], bool], None]], default=None
        None to use the default `StopRemover` matching criteria, or a
        custom callable that defines what constitutes matches of words
        in the text against the stop words. In pre-run validation, SR
        only checks that `match_callable` is None or a callable, no
        validation is done on the callable. It is a heavy burden to
        validate the user-defined callable at every call over a search
        of the entire text body for every stop word, so SR does not
        validate any of it. If the user-defined callable is ill-formed,
        SR could break in unpredictable ways, or, perhaps worse, SR may
        not break and successfully complete the search operation and
        yield nonsensical results. It is up to the user to validate the
        accuracy of their callable and ensure that the output is a
        boolean. When designing the callable, the first string in the
        signature is the word from the text, the second string is a
        stop word. If you have modified your local copy of the `Lexicon`
        and/or the stop words and you intend to use regex in your
        callable, remember that it may be important to use re.escape.
    remove_empty_rows : Optional[bool], default=True
        Whether to remove any rows that are left empty by the stop word
        removal process.
    exempt : Optional[Union[list[str], None]], default=None
        Stop words that are exempted from the search. Text that matches
        these words will not be removed. Ensure that the capitalization
        of the word(s) that you enter exactly matches that of the word(s)
        in the `Lexicon`. Always enter words in majuscule if working with
        the default pybear `Lexicon`.
    supplemental : Optional[Union[list[str], None]], default=None
        Words to be removed in addition to the stop words. If you intend
        to do a case-sensitive search then the capitalization of these
        words matters.
    n_jobs : Optional[Union[numbers.Integral, None]], default = -1
        The number of cores/threads to use when parallelizing the
        search for stop words in the rows of `X`. The default is to use
        processes but can be set by running `StopRemover` under a joblib
        parallel_config context manager. None uses the default number
        of cores/threads. -1 uses all available cores/threads.
