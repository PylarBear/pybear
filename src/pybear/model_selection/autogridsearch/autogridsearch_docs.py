"""Run multiple passes of grid search with progressively narrower search
spaces to find increasingly precise estimates of the best value for each
hyperparameter.

For a quick start to using `AutoGridSearch`, skip to the 'Params
Parameter' section of the docs.

'Best' values are those hyperparameter values within the given search
space that minimize the average loss (or maximize the average score)
across all validation folds for the particular dataset and estimator
being trained.

The sklearn / dask_ml / pybear grid search modules expose these values
through a :attr:`best_params_` attribute. It is a dictionary with
hyperparameter names as keys and respective best values as values
that is (sometimes) exposed after a search over a set of grids.
`autogridsearch_wrapper` wraps these foundational GridSearch classes
creating an `AutoGridSearch` class, and the superseding :meth:`fit`
repeatedly makes calls to the parent's fit method to generate this
`best_params_` attribute.

`AutoGridSearch` requires that the parent exposes the `best_params_`
attribute on every call to its fit method. Grid search configurations
where the parent does not expose the `best_params_` attribute are
detected and rejected by `AutoGridSearch`. The conditions where a parent
grid search module does not expose the `best_params_` attribute are
determined by things such as the number of scorers used and the `refit`
setting. See the docs for your parent grid search module for information
about when the `best_params_` attribute is or is not exposed.

On the first pass of an `AutoGridSearch` session, the first search grids
are constructed from the instructions in the `params` parameter. The
first grids are then passed to the parent GridSearch's 'param_grid'
parameter (or a different parameter such as 'parameters' for some
GridSearch modules) and `fit` is called on the parent. Once the first
search is complete and the `best_params_` attribute is retrieved, new
search grids for the next pass are constructed based on:

• the preceding search grid,
• the results within `best_params_`,
• the hyperparameters' datatypes as specified in `params`,
• and the number of points as specified in `params`.

The new refined grids are then passed to the parent GridSearch again,
another call to fit is made, `best_params_` is retrieved, and
`AutoGridSearch` creates another 'param_grid'. This process is repeated
at least `total_passes` number of times, with each successive pass
returning increasingly precise estimates of the true best hyperparameter
values for the given estimator, dataset, and restrictions imposed in
the `params` parameter.

An example 'param_grid' for a parent GridSearch module:

{'C': [0,5,10], 'l1_ratio': [0, 0.5, 1], 'solver': ['lbfgs', 'saga']}

An example `best_params_` for a parent GridSearch module:

{'C': 10, 'l1_ratio': 0.5, 'solver': 'lbfgs'}

After a session of `AutoGridSearch`, all the familiar attributes of
the parent GridSearch, like :attr:`best_estimator_`, `best_params_`,
and :attr:`best_score_`, etc., are exposed through the `AutoGridSearch`
instance. In addition to those, `AutoGridSearch` exposes other attributes
that capture all the grids and best hyperparameter values for each
pass, the :attr:`GRIDS_` and :attr:`RESULTS_` attributes, as well as
the :attr:`params_` attribute.

The `GRIDS_` attribute is a dictionary of all the search grids used
during the `AutoGridSearch` session. It is a collection of every
'param_grid' passed to the parent GridSearch keyed by the zero-indexed
pass number where that 'param_grid' was used. Similarly, the `RESULTS_`
attribute is a dictionary of all the best values returned by the parent
GridSearch during the `AutoGridSearch` session. It is a collection of
every `best_params_` returned for every 'param_grid' passed, keyed by
the zero-indexed pass number when that `best_params_` was generated.
The `params_` attribute is the version of `params` that was actually
used internally during the `AutoGridSearch` session. Any changes to the
`params` attribute during the `AutoGridSearch` session are captured in
this work-in-process object. Events that alter the originally-passed
`params` include the initial conditioning to the form needed by
`AutoGridSearch` internally, and 'shift passes', which is explained
later in the docs.

`AutoGridSearch` leaves the API of the parent `GridSearchCV` module
intact, and all the parent module's attributes and methods (except `fit`)
are accessible via the `AutoGridSearch` instance. `AutoGridSearch`
is in fact an instance of the parent GridSearch, just with a new `fit`
method and some new parameters. So methods like :meth:`set_params`,
:meth:`get_params`, etc., are accessible just as they would be in a
stand-alone instance of the parent GridSearch.

The parameters of the `AutoGridSearch` instance (`total_passes`,
`max_shifts`, etc.) can be accessed and set directly:

>>> from pybear.model_selection import autogridsearch_wrapper
>>> from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
>>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
>>> # This shows constructing AutoGridSearch from the wrapper.
>>> # The pre-packaged pybear AutoGridSearch modules are already wrapped.
>>> AutoGSCV = autogridsearch_wrapper(GridSearchCV)
>>> estimator = LogisticRegression()
>>> params = {'C': [[1e3, 1e4, 1e5], [3, 11, 11], 'soft_float']}
>>> agscv = AutoGSCV(estimator, params, total_passes=3, max_shifts=1,
...     total_passes_is_hard=True)
>>> # Verify 'total_passes_is_hard' parameter is True
>>> agscv.total_passes_is_hard
True
>>> # Set 'total_passes_is_hard' to False and verify parameter
>>> agscv.total_passes_is_hard = False
>>> agscv.total_passes_is_hard
False

However, this practice is generally discouraged in favor of using
the `get_params` and `set_params` methods, which have protections in
place to prevent against invalid parameters being set.

**Terminology**

Definitions for terms found in the autogridsearch docs.

'linspace' - a search space with intervals that are equal in linear
space, e.g. [1,2,3]. See `numpy.linspace`.

'logspace' - a search space whose log10 intervals are equal, e.g.
[1, 10, 100]. See `numpy.logspace`.

'boolean' (or 'fixed_bool') - True or False

'Universal bound' - A logical lower bound for search spaces that is
enforced thoughout the `AutoGridSearch` module. For 'soft' and 'hard'
integers, the universal lower bound is 1; zero and negative numbers
can never be included in a soft/hard integer search space. For 'soft'
and 'hard' floats, the universal lower bound is zero; negative numbers
can never be included in a soft/hard float search space. `AutoGridSearch`
will terminate if instructions are passed to `params` that violate the
universal bounds. There is no logical upper bound for integers and
floats. Universal bounds do not apply to 'fixed' search spaces.

'fixed' hyperparameter - A hyperparameter whose search space is static.
The search space will not be 'shifted' or 'drilled'. The search grid
provided at the start is the only search grid for every pass, with one
exception. The search space can be shrunk to a single value (i.e., the
best value from the preceding round is the only value searched for all
remaining rounds) by setting the 'points' for the appropriate round(s)
to 1. Consider a search space over depth of a decision tree. A search
space might be [3, 4, 5], where no other values are allowed to be
searched. This would be a 'fixed_integer' search space. In the case of
'fixed_integer', a zero or negative numbers may be passed to the search
grid, breaking the universal minimum bound for integers, whereas all
other integer search spaces observe the universal lower bound of 1.
'fixed_float', 'fixed_string' and 'fixed_bool' are other fixed
hyperparameters.

'hard' hyperparameter - A hyperparameter whose search is bounded to a
contiguous subset of real numbers, observant of the universal hard
bounds. The space will be 'drilled' but cannot be 'shifted'. Consider
searching over `l1_ratio` for a scikit-learn LogisticRegression
classifier. Any real number in the interval [0, 1] is allowed, but not
outside of it. This is a 'hard_float' search space. 'hard_integer' is
the only other 'hard' search space. These search spaces can be shrunk to
a single value in the same way as described for a 'fixed' hyperparameter.

'soft' hyperparameter - A hyperparameter whose search space can be
'shifted' and 'drilled', and is only bounded by the universal bounds.
Consider searching over regularization constant 'alpha' in a scikit
learn RidgeClassifier estimator. 'alpha' can be any non-negative real
number. A starting search space might be [1000, 2000, 3000], which
`AutoGridSearch` can 'shift' and 'drill' to find the most precise
estimate of the best value for 'alpha'. This a 'soft_float' search space.
'soft_integer' is the only other 'soft' search space. These search
spaces can be shrunk to a single value in the same way as described for
a 'fixed' hyperparameter.

'shift' - The act of incrementing or decrementing all the values in a
search grid by a fixed amount if GridSearchCV returns a best value that
falls on one of the ends of the most-recently used grid. This can only
be done on 'soft_integer' and 'soft_float' search spaces; 'fixed'  and
'hard' spaces are not shifted. This is best explained with an example.
Consider a soft integer search space: grid = [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
If the best value returned by GridSearchCV is 20, then a 'left-shift' is
affected by decrementing every value in the grid by max(grid) - grid[1]
-> 3. The search grid for the next round is [17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
Similarly, if the best value returned by GridSearchCV is 24, then a
'right-shift' is affected by incrementing every value in the grid by
grid[-2] - min(grid) -> 3. The search grid for the next round is
[23, 24, 25, 26, 27].  If passed any 'soft' spaces, `AutoGridSearch` will
perform shifting passes until 1) it reaches a pass in which all soft
hyperparameters' best values simultaneously fall off the ends of their
search grids, 2) `max_shifts` is reached, or 3) `total_passes_is_hard`
is True and `total_passes` is reached.

'drill' - The narrowing of a search space. Not applicable to 'fixed'
hyperparameters. Briefly and simply, the next search grid is a 'zoom-in'
on the last round's (sorted) grid in the region bounded by the search
values that are adjacent to the best value. For float search spaces,
all intervals are infinitely divisible and the zoom-in region will
be divided evenly according to the number of points for the next round
provided in `params`. For integer search spaces, when the limit of unit
intervals is approached, the search space is divided with unit intervals
and the number of points to search is adjusted accordingly, regardless
of the number of search points stated in `params`, and `params` is
overwritten with the new number of points.

'regap' - Technically a 'drill', the points in a logspace with log10
interval greater than 1 are repartitioned to unit interval. For example,
a logspace of 1e0, 1e2, 1e4, 1e6 with a best value of 1e2 is 'regapped'
with unit log10 intervals as 1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3, 1e4. In `AutoGridSearch`,
this operation is compulsory for these types of spaces before entering
'drilling', and is handled separately from `drilling`. Any logspaces
that enter the drilling process must be unit log10 interval. All
logspaces are ultimately converted to linear search spaces after their
first drilling pass.

'shrink' -- Reduce a hyperparameter's search grid to a single value (the
best value from the last round), and on that specified pass and all
passes thereafter only use that single value during searches. This saves
time by minimizing repetitive and redundant searches. Consider, for
example, the `fit_intercept` parameter for scikit LogisticRegression.
One might anticipate that this value is impactful and non-volatile,
meaning that one option will likely be clearly better than the other in
a particular situation, and once that value is determined on the first
pass, it is very unlikely to change on subsequent passes. Instead of
performing the same searches repeatedly, the user can set the number of
points for a later pass (and all thereafter) to 1, which will cause the
best value from the previous round to be the only value searched over
in all remaining rounds, while other hyperparameters' grids continue to
'drill'. This technique can be used for all hyperparameters: 'soft',
'hard', and 'fixed'. A 'shrink' pass cannot happen on the first pass,
i.e., you cannot pass a grid with more than one point and then indicate
only 1 point for the first pass; `AutoGridSearch` will overwrite that
first number of points with the actual number of points in the first
grid. The full grid passed to `params` at instantiation must run at
least once for every hyperparameter.

Consider the following instructions that demonstrate how 'shrink' works
on a 'fixed' space. The 'params Parameter' section of the docs explains
how to construct these instructions, but for now focus on the second
position of the following list, which tells `AutoGridSearch` how many
points to use for each pass.

Without shrink: [['a', 'b', 'c'], 3, 'fixed_string']
with `total_passes` = 3 and a true best value of 'c' that is correctly
discovered by `AutoGridSearch`.
This will generate the following search grids:

pass 1: ['a', 'b', 'c']; best value = 'c'

pass 2: ['a', 'b', 'c']; best value = 'c'

pass 3: ['a', 'b', 'c']; best value = 'c'

Now consider these instructions.
With shrink: [['a', 'b', 'c'], [3, 1, 1], 'fixed_string']
with `total_passes` = 3 and a true best value of 'c' that is correctly
discovered by `AutoGridSearch`.
This will generate the following search grids:

pass 1: ['a', 'b', 'c']; best value = 'c'

pass 2: ['c']; best value = 'c'

pass 3: ['c']; best value = 'c'

This reduces the total searching time by minimizing the number of
redundant searches.

**Operation**

There are two distinct regimes in an `AutoGridSearch` session,
'shifting' / 'regapping' and 'drilling'.

Shift / Regap:
First, the default behavior of `AutoGridSearch`, when allowed, is to
shift the grids passed in `params` for 'soft' hyperparameters to the
state where a search round returns best values that are not on the ends
of those search grids. This eliminates the possibility that their true
best values are beyond the ranges of their grids. The consequences of
that condition are two-fold:

1) the optimal estimate of best value for the offending hyperparameter
is not found

2) the optimal estimates for the other hyperparameters are not globally
correct.

Read more about the mechanics of 'shifting' in the 'Terminology' section.

During the 'shifting' process, 'shrink' is not performed on any spaces,
'drilling' is not performed on any 'hard' spaces, nor is any drilling
done on any 'soft' spaces that have already landed inside the ends of
their grids. (`AutoGridSearch` will regap logspaces, if necessary, while
shifing is still taking place, more on that later.) The grids for
hyperparameters that are already 'good to go' during the shifting
process are just replicated into the next round each time a 'shift'
pass needs to be performed, and keep replicating until all non-centered
'soft' hyperparameters center themselves and are ready to go to drilling.

`AutoGridSearch` accepts log10 intervals greater than one, allowing for
search over astronomically large spaces. Once shifting requirements
for that hyperparameter are fulfilled (best value is centered or
`max_shifts` is reached), `AutoGridSearch` regaps that logspace to unit
interval in log10 space. This is to allow sufficient fidelity in the
search grid for other hyperparameters to be able to move freely toward
their true global optima. All hyperparameters with log10 interval
greater than 1 will be regapped before entering the drilling section of
`AutoGridSearch`.

Consider a search space of np.logspace(-15, 15, 7). The corresponding
search grid is [1e-15, 1e-10, 1e-5, 0, 1e5, 1e10, 1e15]. The log10
interval in this space is 5. Imagine the true best value is framed
within the grid range and the grid point closest to it is 1e5, which
is what GridSearch returns. `AutoGridSearch` will regap that space to
[1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3, 1e4, 1e5, 1e6, 1e7, 1e8, 1e9, 1e10] for the next
search round and proceed with shifting other hyperparameters until they
are off the ends of their search grids. If a regap happens on a pass
where all other hyperparameters' shifting requirements were already
satisfied, another round of GridSearch is run with the regapped grid(s)
before proceeding to the drilling section after that round.

Once the shifting process is deemed complete by `AutoGridSearch`, the
algorithm does not allow re-entry into the shifting process where
large-scale shifting takes places. However, small scale shifting can
happen in the drilling section if necessary. While this situation of
needing additional shifting can be handled to an extent, `AutoGridSearch`
is designed to avoid this condition as much as possible by handling all
large-scale shifting first.

By default, `AutoGridSearch` ignores shift passes against the count of
total passes. When a shift is performed, the net effect is to do nothing
more than shift the grids of violating hyperparameters, leaving all
other grids exactly as they were. In essence, `AutoGridSearch` inserts
an exact copy of the last round as the next round, moving what was
previously the next round out by 1 pass, with only the grids of violating
hyperparameters having been shifted. Shrink passes are also pushed out
by 1 pass when a shift pass happens.

The user has some control over how total passes are counted with the
`total_passes_is_hard` parameter. `total_passes` is always the actual
number of passes run by `AutoGridSearch` when `total_passes_is_hard` is
True. This may cause `AutoGridSearch` to fulfill `total_passes` number
of passes, terminate, and return results while still in the 'shifting'
process (which may or may not be desired depending on the user's
goals.) When `total_passes_is_hard` is False, `AutoGridSearch` will
increment `total_passes` for each shifting pass. For example, consider
a situation where `total_passes` is set to 3 and we know beforehand
that `AutoGridSearch` will need two shifting passes to center its search
grids (this is likely impossible to know, but just for example.) On
the first pass, `AutoGridSearch` will peform a shift and increment
`total_passes` by 1 to 4. On the second pass, another shift will be
done, and `total_passes` will be incrememnted by 1 to 5. Now that all
best values are off the ends of their search grids, `AutoGridSearch`
will proceed to complete the initially desired 3 total passes, making 5
actual total passes.

Shifting behavior can be modified with the `max_shifts` parameter. This
is an integer that instructs `AutoGridSearch` to stop shifting after a
certain number of tries and proceed to regapping / drilling regardless
of the state of the search grids, to fulfill the remaining total passes.
The `max_shifts` parameter is useful in cases of asymptotic behavior.
Consider a case where the user has elected to use a soft logarthmic
search space for a hyperparameter whose true best value is zero. The
logarithmic search space will never get there, causing `AutoGridSearch`
to repeatedly shift unabated to the limits of floating point precision.
The `max_shifts` parameter is designed to prevent such a condition,
giving some forgiveness for poor search design. But, in case this does
happen, `AutoGridSearch` does have a fail-safe that will catch floating
point precision failures in logarithmic space, and inform the user with
an error message.

Drill: Once true best values are framed within their grids (or stopped
short) and large logspace intervals are regapped, `AutoGridSearch`
proceeds to further refine 'soft' and 'hard' search spaces by narrowing
(drilling) the search area around the returned best values. 'Fixed'
search spaces cannot be drilled. All 'soft' and 'hard' search spaces are
concurrently drilled. Any 'soft' or 'hard' logarithmic search spaces
(which must have unit gaps in log10 space at this point because of the
regap process) are simultaneously drilled and transitioned to a linear
search space. The drilling process continues until `total_passes` is
satisfied.

In the case where all search grids are 'fixed' (either fixed numerics,
string, or boolean), no drilling takes place. However, `AutoGridSearch`
will continue to perform searches (and likely return the same values
over and over) until `total_passes` is satisfied. It is up to the user
to avoid this condition. The most likely best practice in this case is
to set `total_passes` to 1.

**Refit**

If the parent is a scikit-learn GridSearch that accepts a `refit`
parameter and that value is not False, `AutoGridSearch` will refit
itself but defer it until the final pass to save time, when possible.
In this way, `AutoGridSearch` avoids unnecessary refits during
intermediate passes and only performs the refit on the final best
values. Note that `AutoGridSearch` will not do this with dask_ml
GridSearches, those are always run with the `refit` setting as passed
by the user. Some of the dask_ml GridSearches require that `refit` be
True to expose the `best_params_` attribute.

**Summary of Restrictions**

'Soft' and 'hard' integer search spaces must be greater than or equal
to 1.

'Soft' and 'hard' float search spaces must be greater than or
equal to 0.

'Soft' search grids must have at least 3 points, unless 'shrinking'.

Logarithmic search intervals must be base 10 and the first grid must
contain integers, even for a 'float' space.

Booleans cannot be passed to an 'integer' or 'float' space.

Integers and floats cannot be passed to a boolean space.


**params Parameter**

The `params` parameter must be a dictionary. `AutoGridSearch` cannot
accommodate multiple `params` entries in a list in the same way that
scikit-learn `GridSearchCV` can accomodate multiple param_grids.

The required parameter `params` must be of the following form:

dict(
    'estimator hyperparameter name as string': list-like(...),

    'another estimator hyperparameter name as string': list-like(...),

    ...
)

The list-like field is identical in construction for string, boolean,
and numerical hyperparameters.

For all hyperparameters, the list-like field is constructed as:
    [first search grid: list-like,

    number of points for each pass: int or list-like of ints,

    search type: str]
E.g.:
    [['a', 'b', 'c'], 3, 'fixed_string']

    or

    [[True, False], [2, 1, 1], 'fixed_bool']

    or

    [[1, 2, 3], 3, 'fixed_integer']

    or

    [np.logspace(-5, 5, 3), [3, 3, 3, 3], 'soft_float']


The list-like in the first position is the grid that will be used as the
first search grid for the respective hyperparameter. Create this in the
same way that you would create a search grid for single hyperparameter
in scikit-learn `GridSearchCV`. For 'fixed' hyperparameters, this grid
will also be used for all subsequent searches unless a 'shrink' pass is
specified, e.g. points is set as something like [3, 3, 1, 1]. See
'shrink' in the 'Terminology' section of the docs.

The second position, 'number of points for each pass', must be an integer
greater than zero or a list-like of such integers. If a single integer,
this number will be the number of points in each grid for all searches
after the first pass. If a list-like of integers, the length of the
list-like must equal `total_passes`. The number of points for the first
pass, although required to fulfill the length requirement, is effectively
ignored and overwritten by the actual length of the first grid. Each
subsequent value in the list-like dictates the number of points to put
in the new grid for that respective pass. For integer spaces, the entered
points are overwritten as necessary to maintain an integer space. If any
value in the list-like is entered as 1, all subsequent values must also
be 1. In that case, the best value from the previous pass is used as the
single search value in all subsequent search grids. This reduces the
total searching time by minimizing the number of redundant searches. For
fixed spaces, the only acceptable entries are 1 or the length of the
first (and only possible) grid.

The text field in the final position is required for all entries in
the `params` parameter. This informs `AutoGridSearch` on how to handle
the grids and their values. There are eight allowed entries:

'soft_float' - continous search space only bounded by the universal
minimum for floats

'hard_float' - continuous search space where the minimum and maximum
values of the first grid serve as hard bounds for all searches

'fixed_float' - static grid of float values

'soft_integer' - integer search space only bounded by the universal
minimum for integers

'hard_integer' - integer search space where the minimum and maximum
values of the first grid serve as hard bounds for all searches

'fixed_integer' - static grid of integer values

'fixed_string' - static grid of string values

'fixed_bool' - static grid of boolean values

All together, a fictitious but valid `params` entry for total_passes ==
3 might look like:

{
    'solver': [['lbfgs', 'saga'], [2, 1, 1], 'fixed_string'],

    'max_depth': [[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 4, 1], 'fixed_integer'],

    'C': [np.logspace(1, 3, 3), [3, 11, 11], 'soft_float'],

    'n_estimators': [[20, 40, 60, 80], 4, 'soft_integer'],

    'tol': [np.logspace(-6, -1, 6), 6, 'hard_float']
}


Parameters
----------
estimator : object
    Required. Any estimator that follows the scikit-learn estimator API.
    Includes, at least, scikit-learn, lightGBM, and xgboost estimators.
params : ParamsType
    Required. Instructions for building search grids for all
    hyperparameters. See the 'params Parameter' section of the docs
    for a lengthy, detailed, discussion on constructing this and how it
    works.
total_passes : Optional[numbers.Integral], default=5
    The number of grid searches to perform. The actual number of passes
    can be different from this number based on the setting for the
    `total_passes_is_hard` parameter. If `total_passes_is_hard` is True,
    then the actual number of total passes will always be the value
    assigned to `total_passes`. If `total_passes_is_hard` is False, a
    round that performs a 'shift' operation will increment the total
    number of passes, essentially causing shift passes to not count
    toward the total number of passes. More information about 'shifting'
    can be found in the 'Terminology' and 'Operation' sections of the
    docs.
total_passes_is_hard : Optional[bool], default=False
    If True, `total_passes` is the exact number of grid searches that
    will be performed. If False, rounds in which a 'shift' takes place
    will increment the total passes, essentially causing 'shift' passes
    to be ignored against the total count of grid searches.
max_shifts : Optional[Union[None, numbers.Integral]], default=None
    The maximum number of 'shifting' searches allowed. If None, there is
    no limit to the number of shifts that `AutoGridSearch` will perform
    when trying to center search grids.
agscv_verbose : Optional[bool], default=False
    Display the status of `AutoGridSearch` and other helpful information
    during the `AutoGridSearch` session, in addition to any verbosity
    displayed by the underlying `GridsearchCV` module. This parameter is
    separate from any 'verbose' parameter that the parent GridSearch may
    have, and any setting for that parent parameter needs to be manually
    entered by the user separately.
**parent_gscv_kwargs : Optional[dict[str, Any]]
    Any keyword arguments to be passed to the parent grid search module.
