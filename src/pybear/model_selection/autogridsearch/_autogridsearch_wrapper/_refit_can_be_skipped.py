) -> bool:

    """
    Determine if the parent GridSearch, the scoring strategy, and the
    total number of passes allow for refits to be skipped until the
    final pass. Some GridSearch parents (like dask_ml as of this writing)
    require that `refit` be True to expose `best_params_`. All require
    that `refit` be specified if `scoring` is multiple scorers to expose
    `best_params_`. Refit cannot be skipped if agscv is only running one
    pass.

    This ignores whether `refit` was originally passed as False. If it
    was, then this module will still allow agscv to overwrite pre-final
    pass `refit` with False, which is just overwriting the same value.


    Parameters
    ----------
    _GridSearchParent:
        GridSearchCV instance - the parent GridSearchCV class passed to
        the agscv wrapper.
    _scoring:
        Union[None, str, list, Callable, dict, Literal[False]] -
        the value passed to the `scoring` parameter of the parent
        GridSearchCV. On the off chance that the parent GridSearch does
        not have a `scoring` parameter, Literal[False] is passed to here.
    _total_passes:
        int - the number of grid searches to perform. This number is
        dynamic and can be incremented by agscv during a run, based on
        the need to shift grids and the setting of `total_passes_is_hard`.


    Returns
    -------
    -
        _refit_can_be_skipped: bool - whether or not to allow refits to
        be skipped until the last pass of agscv.
