    """Using the estimators fit on each train fold, use `predict_proba`
    and _X_trains to generate _y_preds and score against the
    corresponding _y_trains using all of the scorers.

    Fill one layer of the TRAIN_FOLD_x_SCORER__SCORE.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X_train : SKXType
        A train partition of the data that was fit.
    _y_train : SKYType
        The corresponding train partition of the target for the X train
        partition.
    _FIT_OUTPUT_TUPLE : tuple[ClassifierProtocol, float, bool]
        A tuple holding the fitted estimator, the fit time (not needed
        here), and the fit_excepted boolean (needed here.)
    _f_idx : int
        The zero-based split index of the train partition used here;
        parallelism occurs over the different splits.
    _SCORER_DICT : ScorerWIPType
        A dictionary with scorer name as keys and the scorer callables
        as values. The scorer callables are scoring metrics (or similar),
        not 'make_scorer'.
    _BEST_THRESHOLDS_BY_SCORER : NDArrayHolderType
        After all of the fold / threshold / scorer combinations are
        scored, the folds are averaged and the threshold with the maximum
        score for each scorer is found. This vector has length n_scorers
        and in each position holds a float indicating the threshold
        value that is the best threshold for that scorer.
    _error_score : Union[numbers.Real, Literal['raise']]
        If this training fold excepted during fitting and `error_score`
        was set to the 'raise' literal, this module cannot be reached.
        Otherwise, a number or number-like was passed to `error_score`.
        If 'fit_excepted' is True, this module puts the `error_score`
        value in every position of the TRAIN_SCORER__SCORE_LAYER vector.
        If `error_score` is set to np.nan, that layer is also masked.
    _verbose : int
        A number from 0 to 10 that indicates the amount of information
        to display to the screen during the grid search process. 0 means
        no output, 10 means maximum output.

    Returns
    -------
    TRAIN_SCORER__SCORE_LAYER : MaskedHolderType
        Masked array of shape (n_scorers, ). The score for this fold of
        train data using every scorer and the best threshold associated
        with that scorer.
