    """Condition `param_grid` and any thresholds that may be passed inside.

    Get it/them into list(dict[str, list[Any]]) format. If any grid does
    not have thresholds in it, put the init `thresholds` in it. Condition
    any thresholds that were passed in a `param_grid` into a py list of
    floats.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _param_grid : Union[ParamGridInputType, ParamGridsInputType]
        A 'param_grid' is a dictionary with hyperparameter names (str)
        as keys and list-likes of hyperparameter settings to test as
        values. `_param_grid` can be one of the described param_grids,
        or a list-like of such param_grids.
    _thresholds : ThresholdsInputType
        The global decision threshold strategy to use when performing
        hyperparameter search, for those param_grids that did not have
        thresholds passed inside.

    Returns
    -------
    _out_param_grid : ParamGridsWIPType
        Returns param grid(s) inside a list with thresholds inside every
        param_grid, no matter how (or if) thresholds was passed in the
        param_grid.
