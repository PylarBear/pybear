    return_train_score:
        bool - If False, the cv_results_ attribute will not include
        training scores. Computing training scores is used to get
        insights on how different parameter settings impact the
        overfitting/underfitting trade-off. However, computing the scores
        on the training set can be computationally expensive and is not
        strictly required to select the parameters that yield the best
        generalization performance.
