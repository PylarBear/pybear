) -> DaskSchedulerType:

    """
    The passed scheduler supersedes all other external schedulers. If
    "None" was passed to the scheduler kwarg of GSTCVDask (the default),
    look for an external context manager or global scheduler using
    get_client. If one exists, use nullcontext as an internal context
    manager to not interfere with the external scheduler. If "None" was
    passed to the scheduler kwarg of GSTCVDask and there is no external
    scheduler, instantiate distributed.Client(), which defaults to
    LocalCluster, with n_workers=n_jobs and 1 thread per worker. If
    n_jobs is None, uses the default distributed.Client behavior when
    n_workers is set to None.

    If a scheduler is passed, this module does not perform any validation
    but allows that to be handled by dask at compute time.

    This module intentionally deviates from the dask_ml API, and disallows
    any shorthand methods for setting up a scheduler (such as strings
    like 'threading' and 'multiprocessing', which are ultimately passed
    to dask.base.get_scheduler.) All of these types of configurations
    should be handled by the user external to the GSTCVDask module. As
    much as possible, dask and distributed objects are allowed to flow
    through without any hard-coded input.

        for compute

    ------
    -
        _scheduler: DaskSchedulerType - validated, instantiated scheduler
