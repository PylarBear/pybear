    """
    Use dask_ml KFold to get train / test splits when cv is passed as an
    integer. KFold uses the number of rows in _X and _n_splits to
    determine the indices in each train / test split. y is optional in
    dask_ml KFold. If passed, the number of rows in _X and _y must be
    equal.

    *** IMPORTANT!!!
    This function can be called multiple times within a single param grid
    permutation, first to fit, again to get test score, then again if
    return_train_score. Therefore, it must return the same indices for
    each call. The only things that should cause indices to be different
    are n_splits and the number of rows in _X. Since this is dask KFold,
    there is the wildcard of the 'iid' setting. If iid is False --
    meaning the data is known to have some non-random grouping along
    axis 0 -- via the 'shuffle' argument KFold will generate indices that
    sample across chunks to randomize the data in the splits. In that
    case, fix the random_state parameter to make selection repeatable.
    If iid is True, shuffle is False, random_state can be None, and the
    splits should be repeatable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    _X:
        DaskXType - The data to be split.
    _n_splits:
        int - the number of splits to produce; the number of split pairs
        yielded by the returned generator object.
    _iid:
        bool - True, the examples in X are distributed randomly; False,
        there is some kind of non-random ordering of the examples in X.
    _verbose:
        int - a number from 0 to 10 indicating the amount of information
        to display to screen during the grid search trials. 0 means no
        output, 10 means full output.
    _y:
        Optional[DaskYType] - The target the data is being fit
        against, to be split in the same way as the data.


    Return
    ------
    -
        KFOLD: Iterator[DaskKFoldType] - A generator object yielding
        pairs of train test indices as da.core.Array[int].
