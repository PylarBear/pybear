) -> tuple[DaskSplitType, ...]:

    """
    Split given data objects into train / test pairs using the given
    train and test indices. The train and test indices independently
    slice the given data objects; the entire data object need not be
    consumed in a train / test split and the splits can also possibly
    share indices. Standard indexing rules apply. Returns a tuple whose
    length is equal to the number of data objects passed, holding tuples
    of the train / test splits for the respective data objects.
    train_idxs and test_idxs must be 1D vectors of indices, not booleans.


    Parameters
    ----------
    train_idxs:
        DaskSlicerType - 1D vector of row indices used to slice train
        sets out of every given data object.
    test_idxs:
        DaskSlicerType - 1D vector of row indices used to slice test
        sets out of every given data object.
    *data_objects:
        Union[DaskXType, DaskYType] - The data objects to slice. Need
        not be of equal size, and need not be completely consumed in the
        train / test splits. However, standard indexing rules apply when
        slicing by train_idxs and test_idxs.


    Return
    ------
    -
        SPLITS: tuple[DaskSplitType, ...] - return the train / test
        splits for the given data objects in the order
        passed in a tuple of tuples, each inner tuple containing a
        train/test pair.
