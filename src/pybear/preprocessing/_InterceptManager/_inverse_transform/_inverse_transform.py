    """Revert transformed data back to its original state.

    IM cannot account for any nan-like values that may have been in the
    original data (unless the column was all nans).

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X : InternalXContainer of shape (n_samples, n_transformed_features)
        A transformed data set. Any appended intercept column (via
        a `keep` dictionary) needs to be removed before coming into this
        module. The container must be numpy ndarray, pandas dataframe,
        polars dataframe, or scipy csc only.
    _removed_columns : RemovedColumnsType
        The keys are the indices of constant columns removed from the
        original data, the respective values are the constant that was
        in that column.
    _feature_names_in : Union[FeatureNamesInType, None]
        The feature names found during fitting, if `X` was passed in a
        container with a header.

    Returns
    -------
    X_tr : InternalXContainer of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Transformed data reverted to its original state.
