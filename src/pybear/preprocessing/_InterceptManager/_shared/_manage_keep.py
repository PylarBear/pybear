    """Before going into `_make_instructions`, process some of the
    mapping of `keep` to a column index and validate against
    `_constant_columns`.

    Helps to simplify `_make_instructions` and makes for easier testing.

    If dict[int, Any], just pass through without validation.
    If callable, convert to int and verify is a constant column.
    If a feature name, convert to int and verify is a constant column.
    If a `keep` literal ('first', 'last', 'random'):
        if there are no constant columns, warn and set `keep` to 'none'
        otherwise map to a column index.
    If `keep` literal 'none':
        if there are no constant columns, warn, otherwise pass through.
    If `keep` is integer, verify is a constant column.


    FROM columns & keep VALIDATION, WE KNOW ** * ** * ** * ** * ** * **

    `feature_names_in_` could be:
        type(None),
        Sequence[str] whose len == X.shape[1]

    `keep` could be
        Literal['first', 'last', 'random', 'none'],
        dict[str, Any],
        callable(X),
        int,
        a feature name

    if `keep` is str in ('first', 'last', 'random', 'none'):
    	if 'feature_names_in_' is not None, keep literal is not in it
    if `keep` is dict:
    	len == 1
    	key is str
    	warns if 'feature_names_in_' is not None and key is in it
        value cannot be callable, cannot be non-str sequence
    if `keep` is callable(X):
    	output is int
    	output is not bool
    	output is in range(X.shape[1])
    if `keep` is number:
    	is int
    	is not bool
    	is in range(X.shape[1])
    if `keep` is str not in literals:
    	`feature_names_in_` cannot be None
    	`keep` must be in `feature_names_in_`

    END WHAT WE KNOW FROM columns & keep VALIDATION ** * ** * ** * ** *

    RULES FOR `_manage_keep`:

    `feature_names_in_` is not changed

    `keep`:
    --'first', 'last', 'random'         converted to int, validated--
    --'none'                            passes thru--
    --dict[str, Any]                    passes thru--
    --callable(X)                       converted to int, validated--
    --int                               validated--
    --a feature name                    converted to int, validated--

    keep can only leave here as dict[int, Any], int, or Literal['none']

    Parameters
    ----------
    _keep : KeepType
        The strategy for handling the constant columns. See 'The keep
        Parameter' section for a lengthy explanation of the `keep`
        parameter.
    _X : XContainer of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data that was searched for constant columns. The data need
        not be InternalXContainer.
    _constant_columns : ConstantColumnsType
        Constant column indices and their values found in all partial
        fits.
    _n_features_in : int
        Number of features in the fitted data before transform.
    _feature_names_in : Union[npt.NDArray[str], None]
        The names of the features as seen during fitting. Only accessible
        if `X` is passed to `fit` or `partial_fit` in a container that
        has a header.
    _rand_idx : int
        Instance attribute that specifies the random column index to
        keep when `keep` is 'random'. This value must be static on calls
        to `transform`.

    Returns
    -------
    __keep : Union[dict[int, Any], int, Literal['none']]
        `_keep` converted to integer for callable, 'first', 'last',
        'random', or feature name. `__keep` can only return as an
        integer, dict, or Literal['none']
