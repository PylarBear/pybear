def _make_instructions(

    constant_columns_: ConstantColumnsType,
    _n_features_in: int
) -> InstructionType:
    """Based on the `keep` instructions provided, and the constant
    columns found during fitting, build a dictionary that gives explicit
    instructions about what constant columns to keep, delete, or add.
    `keep` must have been conditioned into dict[str, Any], int, or
    Literal['none'] before this module in :func:`_manage_keep`.


    The form of the dictionary is:
    {
        'keep': Union[None, list[constant column indices to keep]],
        'delete': Union[None, list[constant column indices to delete]],
        'add': Union[None, dict['{new column name}', fill value]]
    }

    if `keep` == 'none', keep none, add none, delete all.
    if `keep` == a dict, keep none, delete all, append fill value to data.
    if `keep` == int, keep that idx, delete the remaining constant columns.

    `keep` callable, str feature name, and the other str literals besides
    'none' should not get in here, should have been converted to int
    in :func:`_manage_keep`.

    The column that is to be built by 'add' is not added to `keep`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _keep : Union[int, Literal['none'], dict[str, Any]]
        The strategy for handling the constant columns. See 'The keep
        Parameter' section for a lengthy explanation of the `keep`
        parameter.
    constant_columns_ : ConstantColumnsType
        Constant column indices and their values found in all partial
        fits.
    _n_features_in : int
        Number of features in the fitted data before transform.

    Returns
    -------
    _instructions : InstructionType
        Instructions for keeping, deleting, or adding constant columns
        to be applied during transform.
