    """Validate `keep` and `columns`.

    Validate `columns`:
        must be None or Sequence[str] with len==X.shape[1]

    Validate `keep`:
        must be any of:
            Literal['first', 'last', 'random', 'none'],
            dict[str, Any],
            int (column index),
            str (feature name),
            callable(X) that returns an integer (column index)

        `keep` dict:
            must be len==1
            key is str
            warns if key already in columns
            value cannot be list-like or callable
        `keep` callable:
            must return non-bool integer in range of num features
        `keep` as column index:
            must be non-bool integer, in range of num features
        `keep` str literal:
            must be lower case
            cannot conflict with a feature name
        `keep` feature str:
            columns must be passed
            must be in columns

    Parameters
    ----------
    _keep : KeepType
        The strategy for handling the constant columns. See 'The keep
        Parameter' section for a lengthy explanation of the `keep`
        parameter.
    _columns : Union[NDArray[str], None] of shape (n_features,)
        Exposed if `X` was passed in a container that has a header,
        otherwise None.
    _X : XContainer of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to be searched for constant columns.

    Returns
    -------
    None
