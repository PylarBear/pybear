    """A scikit-style transformer that identifies and manages the
    constant columns in a dataset.

    A dataset may contain columns with constant values for a variety of
    reasons, some intentional, some circumstantial. The use of a column
    of constants in a dataset may be a design consideration for some
    data analytics algorithms, such as multiple linear regression.
    Therefore, the presence of one such column may be desirable.

    The presence of multiple constant columns is generally a degenerate
    condition. In many data analytics learning algorithms, such a
    condition can cause convergence problems, inversion problems, or
    other undesirable effects. The analyst is often forced to address
    the issue to perform a meaningful analysis of the data.

    `InterceptManager` (IM) has several key characteristics that make it
    a versatile and powerful tool that can help fix this condition.

    IM...

    1) handles numerical and non-numerical data

    2) accepts nan-like values, and has flexibility in dealing with them

    3) has a partial fit method for batch-wise fitting and transforming

    4) has parameters that give flexibility to how 'constant' is defined

    5) can remove all, keep one, or append a column of constants to data

    The methodology that IM uses to identify a constant column is
    different for numerical and non-numerical data.

    In the simplest situation with non-numerical data where nan-like
    values are not involved, the computation is simply to determine the
    number of unique values in the column. If there is only one unique
    value, then the column is constant.

    The computation for numerical columns is slightly more complex.
    IM calculates the mean of the column then compares it against the
    individual values via `numpy.allclose`. allclose has 'rtol' and
    'atol' parameters that give latitude to the definition of 'equal'.
    They provide a tolerance window whereby numerical data that are not
    exactly equal are considered equal if their difference falls within
    the tolerance. IM affords some flexibility in defining 'equal'
    when identifying constants by providing direct access to the
    `numpy.allclose` 'rtol' and 'atol' parameters via its own, identically
    named, `rtol` and `atol` parameters. IM requires that `rtol` and
    `atol` be non-boolean, non-negative real numbers, in addition to any
    other restrictions enforced by `numpy.allclose`. See the numpy docs
    for clarification of the technical details.

    The `equal_nan` parameter controls how IM handles nan-like values.
    If `equal_nan` is True, exclude any nan-like values from the allclose
    comparison. This essentially assumes that the nan values are equal
    to the mean of the non-nan values within their column. nan-like
    values will not in and of themselves cause a column to be considered
    non-constant when `equal_nan` is True. If `equal_nan` is False, IM
    does not make the same assumption that the nan values are implicitly
    equal to the mean of the non-nan values, thus making the column not
    constant. This is in line with the normal numpy handling of nan-like
    values. See the Notes section below for a discussion on the handling
    of nan-like values.

    IM also has a `keep` parameter that allows the user to manage
    the constant columns that are identified. `keep` accepts several
    types of arguments. The 'Keep' discussion section has a list of all
    the options that can be passed to `keep`, what they do, and how to
    use them.

    The :meth:`partial_fit`, :meth:`fit`, and :meth:`inverse_transform`
    methods of IM accept data as numpy arrays, pandas dataframes, polars
    dataframes, and scipy sparse matrices/arrays. :meth:`transform`
    and :meth:`fit_transform` also accept these containers, but the
    type of output container for these methods can be controlled by
    the :meth:`set_output` method. The user can set the type of
    output container regardless of the type of input container. Output
    containers available via `set_output` are numpy arrays, pandas
    dataframes, and polars dataframes. When `set_output` is None, the
    output container is the same as the input, that is, numpy array,
    pandas or polars dataframe, or scipy sparse matrix/array.

    The `partial_fit` method allows for incremental fitting of data.
    This makes IM suitable for use with packages that do batch-wise
    fitting and transforming, such as dask_ml via the Incremental and
    ParallelPostFit wrappers.

    There are no safeguards in place to prevent the user from changing
    the `rtol`, `atol`, or `equal_nan` values between calls to
    `partial_fit`. These 3 parameters have strong influence over whether
    IM classifies a column as constant, and therefore is instrumental in
    dictating what IM learns during fitting. Changes to these parameters
    between partial fits can drastically change IM's understanding of
    the constant columns in the data versus what would otherwise be
    learned under constant settings. pybear recommends against this
    practice, however, it is not strictly blocked.

    When performing multiple batch-wise transformations of data, that
    is, making sequential calls to `transform`, it is critical that the
    same column indices be kept / removed at each call. This issue
    manifests when `keep` is set to 'random'; the random index to keep
    must be the same at all calls to `transform`, and cannot be
    dynamically randomized within `transform`. IM handles this by
    generating a static random column index to keep at fit time, and
    does not change this number during transform time. This number is
    dynamic with each call to `partial_fit`, and will likely change at
    each call. Fits performed after calls to `transform` will change
    the random index away from that used in the previous transforms,
    causing IM to perform entirely different transformations than those
    previously being done. IM cannot block calls to `partial_fit` after
    `transform` has been called, but pybear strongly discourages this
    practice because the output will be nonsensical. pybear recommends
    doing all partial fits consecutively, then doing all transformations
    consecutively.

    **The 'keep' Parameter**

    IM learns which columns are constant during fitting. At the time
    of transform, IM applies the instruction given to it via the `keep`
    parameter. The `keep` parameter takes several types of arguments,
    providing various ways to manage the columns of constants within a
    dataset. Below is a comprehensive list of all the arguments that can
    be passed to `keep`.

    Literal 'first':
        Retains the constant column left-most in the data (if any) and
        deletes any others. Must be lower case. Does not except if there
        are no constant columns.
    Literal 'last':
        The default setting, keeps the constant column right-most in the
        data (if any) and deletes any others. Must be lower case. Does
        not except if there are no constant columns.
    Literal 'random':
        Keeps a single randomly-selected constant column (if any) and
        deletes any others. Must be lower case. Does not except if there
        are no constant columns.
    Literal 'none':
        Removes all constant columns (if any). Must be lower case. Does
        not except if there are no constant columns.
    integer:
        An integer indicating the column index in the original data to
        keep, while removing all other columns of constants. IM will
        raise an exception if this passed index is not a column of
        constants.
    string:
        A string indicating feature name to keep if a container with
        a header is passed, while deleting all other constant columns.
        Case sensitive. IM will except if 1) a string is passed that
        is not an allowed string literal ('first', 'last', 'random',
        'none') but a valid container is not passed to `fit`, 2) a valid
        container is passed to `fit` but the given feature name is not
        valid, 3) the feature name is valid but the column is not
        constant.
    callable(X):
        a callable that returns a valid column index when the data is
        passed to it, indicating the index of the column of constants to
        keep while deleting all other columns of constants. This enables
        the analyst to use characteristics of the data being transformed
        to determine which column of constants to keep. IM passes the
        data as-is directly to the callable without any preprocessing.
        The callable needs to operate on the data object directly.
        IM will except if 1) the callable does not return an integer,
        2) the integer returned is out of the range of columns in the
        passed data, 3) the integer that is returned does not correspond
        to a constant column.
        IM does not retain state information about what indices have
        been returned from the callable during transform. IM cannot catch
        if the callable is returning different indices for different
        batches of data within a sequence of calls to `transform`. When
        doing multiple batch-wise transforms, it is up to the user to
        ensure that the callable returns the same index for each call to
        `transform`. If the callable returns a different index for any
        of the batches of data passed in a sequence of transforms then
        the results will be nonsensical.
    dictionary[str, Any]:
        dictionary of {feature name:str, constant value:Any}. A column
        of constants is appended to the right end of the data, with the
        constant being the value in the dictionary. The `keep` dictionary
        requires a single key:value pair. The key must be a string
        indicating feature name. This applies to any format of data that
        is transformed. If the data is a pandas or polars dataframe,
        then this string will become the feature name of the new constant
        feature. If the fitted data is a numpy array or scipy sparse,
        then this column name is ignored. The dictionary value is the
        constant value for the new feature. This value has only two
        restrictions: it cannot be a non-string sequence (e.g. list,
        tuple, etc.) and it cannot be a callable. Essentially, the
        constant value is restricted to being integer, float, string, or
        boolean.

        When appending a constant value to a pandas dataframe, if the
        constant is numeric it is appended as numpy.float64; if it is
        not numeric it is appended as Python object. When appending a
        constant value to a polars dataframe, if the constant is numeric
        it is appended as polars.Float64; if it is not numeric it is
        appended as polars.Object. Otherwise, if the constant is being
        appended to a numpy array or scipy sparse it will be forced to
        the dtype of the transformed data (with some caveats.)

        When transforming a pandas dataframe or polars dataframe and
        the new feature name is already a feature in the data, there
        are two possible outcomes. 1) If the original feature is not
        constant, the new constant values will overwrite in the old
        column (generally an undesirable outcome.) 2) If the original
        feature is constant, the original column will be removed and a
        new column with the same name will be appended with the new
        constant values. IM will warn about this condition but not
        terminate the program. It is up to the user to manage the
        feature names in this situation.

        The :attr:`column_mask_` attribute is not adjusted for the new
        feature appended by the `keep` dictionary (see the discussion on
        `column_mask_`.) But the `keep` dictionary does make adjustment
        to :meth:`get_feature_names_out`. Because `get_feature_names_out`
        reflects the state of transformed data, and the `keep` dictionary
        modifies the data at transform time, `get_feature_names_out`
        reflects this modification. `column_mask_` is intended to be
        applied to pre-transform data, therefore that dimensionality is
        preserved.

    To access the `keep` literals ('first', 'last', 'random', 'none'),
    these MUST be passed as lower-case. If a pandas or polars dataframe
    is fitted and there is a conflict between a literal that has been
    passed to `keep` and a feature name, IM will raise because it is not
    clear to IM whether you want to indicate the literal or the feature
    name. To afford a little more flexibility with feature names, IM
    does not normalize case for this parameter. This means that if
    `keep` is passed as 'first',  feature names such as 'First', 'FIRST',
    'FiRsT', etc. will not raise, only 'first' will.

    The only value that removes all constant columns is 'none'. All other
    valid arguments for `keep` leave one column of constants behind and
    all other constant columns are removed from the dataset. If IM does
    not find any constant columns, 'first', 'last', 'random', and 'none'
    will not raise an exception. It is like telling IM: "I don't know if
    there are any constant columns, but if you find some, then apply
    this rule." However, if using an integer, feature name, or callable,
    IM will raise an exception if it does not find a constant column at
    that index. It is like telling IM: "I know that this column is
    constant, and you need to keep it and remove any others." If IM
    finds that it is not constant, it will raise an exception because
    you lied to it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    keep : Optional[KeepType], default='last'
        The strategy for handling the constant columns. See 'The keep
        Parameter' section for a lengthy explanation of the 'keep'
        parameter.
    equal_nan : Optional[bool], default=True
        If `equal_nan` is True, exclude nan-likes from computations that
        discover constant columns. This essentially assumes that the nan
        value would otherwise be equal to the mean of the non-nan values
        in the same column. If `equal_nan` is False and any value in a
        column is nan, do not assume that the nan value is equal to the
        mean of the non-nan values in the same column, thus making the
        column non-constant. This is in line with the normal numpy
        handling of nan values.
    rtol : Optional[numbers.Real], default=1e-5
        The relative difference tolerance for equality. Must be a
        non-boolean, non-negative, real number. See `numpy.allclose`.
    atol : Optional[numbers.Real], default=1e-8
        The absolute difference tolerance for equality. Must be a
        non-boolean, non-negative, real number. See `numpy.allclose`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features in the fitted data before transform.
    feature_names_in_ : numpy.ndarray[object]
        The feature names seen during fitting. Only accessible if `X`
        is passed to :meth:`partial_fit` or :meth:`fit` as a pandas or
        polars dataframe that has a header.
    constant_columns_
    kept_columns_
    removed_columns_
    column_mask_

    Notes
    -----
    Concerning the handling of nan-like representations. While IM
    accepts data in the form of numpy arrays, pandas dataframes, polars
    dataframes, and scipy sparse matrices/arrays, internally copies are
    extracted from the source data as numpy arrays (see below for more
    detail about how scipy sparse is handled.) After the conversion
    to numpy array and prior to calculating the mean and applying
    `numpy.allclose`, IM identifies any nan-like representations in the
    numpy array and standardizes all of them to numpy.nan. The user
    needs to be wary that whatever is used to indicate 'not-a-number'
    in the original data must first survive the conversion to numpy
    array, then be recognizable by IM as nan-like, so that IM can
    standardize it to numpy.nan. nan-like representations that are
    recognized by IM include, at least, numpy.nan, pandas.NA, None (of
    type None, not string 'None'), and string representations of 'nan'
    (not case sensitive).

    Concerning the handling of infinity. IM has no special handling for
    the various infinity-types, e.g, numpy.inf, -numpy.inf, float('inf'),
    float('-inf'), etc. This is a design decision to not force infinity
    values to numpy.nan. IM falls back to the native handling of these
    values for Python and numpy. Specifically, numpy.inf==numpy.inf and
    float('inf')==float('inf').

    Concerning the handling of scipy sparse arrays. When searching for
    constant columns, chunks of columns are converted to dense numpy
    arrays one chunk at a time. Each chunk is sliced from the data in
    sparse form and is converted to numpy ndarray via the 'toarray'
    method. This a compromise that causes some memory expansion but
    allows for efficient handling of constant column calculations that
    would otherwise involve implicit non-dense values.
