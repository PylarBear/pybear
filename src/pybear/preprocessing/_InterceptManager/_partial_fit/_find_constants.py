) -> ConstantColumnsType:
    """Scan across the columns of `_X` looking for columns of constants.

    Use :funct:`_columns_getter` to pull columns from `_X` as numpy
    arrays. Use :func:`_parallel_constant_finder` to determine the
    constancy of a column with respect to `rtol`, `atol`, and `equal_nan`.
    Render the constant columns found as dict[int, Any], with column
    indices as keys and the respective constant values of the columns as
    values.


    Parameters
    ----------
    _X : XInternalContainer of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to be searched for constant columns. `_X` will be
        passed to :func:`_columns_getter` and must observe the container
        restrictions imposed there. `_X` should be in the correct state
        when passed to this module.
    _equal_nan : bool
        If `equal_nan` is True, exclude nan-likes from computations
        that discover constant columns. This essentially assumes that
        the nan value would otherwise be equal to the mean of the non-nan
        values in the same column. If `equal_nan` is False and any value
        in a column is nan, do not assume that the nan value is equal to
        the mean of the non-nan values in the same column, thus making
        the column non-constant. This is in line with the normal numpy
        handling of nan values.
    _rtol : numbers.Real
        The relative difference tolerance for equality. Must be a
        non-boolean, non-negative, real number. See numpy.allclose.
    _atol : numbers.Real
        The absolute difference tolerance for equality. Must be a
        non-boolean, non-negative, real number. See numpy.allclose.

    Returns
    -------
    _new_constants : ConstantColumnsType
        Dictionary of the indices of the columns of constants and the
        values in them for the current partial fit.

    # benefit. The cost of serializing the data is not worth it for the
    # light task of checking if the column is constant.

    # the original attempt at this was passing all col indices in _X to
    # columns_getter and passing the whole thing as np to _pcf. It turned

    # if pulling one column at a time, still with some memory spike but
    # much smaller, and get some economy of scale with the speed of
