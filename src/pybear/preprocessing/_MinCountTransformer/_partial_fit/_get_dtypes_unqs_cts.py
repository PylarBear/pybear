    # the original attempt at this was passing all col indices in _X to
    # columns_getter and passing the whole thing as np to _pduc. It
    # turned out that this was creating a brief but huge spike in RAM

    # the benefit of less calls to _columns_getter & _pduc than would be
    # if pulling one column at a time, still with some memory spike but
    # much smaller, and get some economy of scale with the speed of
    # scanning a ndarray chunk.
