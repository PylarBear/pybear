    """Make delete instructions for a column with three or more unique
    non-nan values that is handled as bool.

    Because `_handle_as_bool` is True, `_delete_axis_0` matters.

    WHEN 3 items (NOT INCLUDING nan):
    *** BIN INT COLUMNS ARE HANDLED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER DTYPES ***
    Most importantly, if a bin int column has a value below threshold,
    the DEFAULT behavior is to not delete the respective rows (whereas
    any other dtype will delete the rows), essentially causing bin int
    columns with insufficient count to just be deleted.

    classify uniques into two classes - 'zero' and 'non-zero'

    if no nans or ignoring
      look at the cts in the 2 classes (bool False & bool True)
      if any below threshold
          if `delete_axis_0`, mark associated values to delete
          DELETE COLUMN
    if not ignoring nans
      if `delete_axis_0`:
          look at the cts in the 2 classes and nan ct
          if any below threshold
              mark associated values to delete
          if either zero or non-zero classes below threshold
              DELETE COLUMN
      if not `delete_axis_0`
          look at the cts in the 2 classes
          if any of zero or non-zero classes below threshold
          DELETE COLUMN
          if no class below threshold, column is staying, look at nan ct,
          if below threshold, delete nan rows

    Parameters
    ----------
    _threshold : int
        The minimum frequency threshold for this column
    _nan_key : Union[float, str, Literal[False]]
        The nan value in the column. `_columns_getter` converts all
        nan-likes to numpy.nan.
    _nan_ct : Union[int,  Literal[False]]
        The frequency of nan in the column
    _COLUMN_UNQ_CT_DICT : dict[DataType, int]
        The value from `_total_cts_by_column` for this column which is a
        dictionary that holds the uniques and their frequencies. Must
        have had nan removed, and must have at least 3 non-nan uniques.
    _delete_axis_0 : bool
        Whether to delete along the sample axis if either or both of the
        boolean values fall below the minimum count threshold.

    Return
    ------
    _instr_list : list[Union[Literal['DELETE COLUMN', DataType]]
        The row and column operation instructions for this column.
