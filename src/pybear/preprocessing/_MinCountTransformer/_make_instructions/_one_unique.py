    """Make delete instructions for a column with one unique non-nan
    value.

    *** CONSTANT COLUMNS ARE HANDLED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER DTYPES ***
    No matter how many nans are in the column, or whether `ignore_nan`
    is True or False, and no matter how many non-nan values are in the
    column, or if either fall below the threshold, delete the column
    without deleting any rows. After all, it is just a column of
    constants with or without some nans mixed in.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _threshold : int
        The threshold value for the selected column.
    _nan_key : Union[float, str, Literal[False]]
        The nan value found in the data. all nan-likes are converted to
        numpy.nan by :func:`_columns_getter`.
    _nan_ct : Union[int, Literal[False]]
        The number of nans found in this column.
    _COLUMN_UNQ_CT_DICT : dict[DataType, int]
        The value from `_total_cts_by_column` for this column which is a
        dictionary that holds the uniques and their frequencies. must
        have 1 non-nan key:value pair in it (any nan key:value pair that
        may have been it must have already been removed.)

    Returns
    -------
    _instr_list : list[Literal['DELETE COLUMN']]
        The row and column operation instructions for this column. Can
        only be to delete the entire column without deleting rows.
