    """Make delete instructions for a column with two unique non-nan
    values, handling values as booleans.

    WHEN 2 items (NOT INCLUDING nan):
    *** BINARY INT COLUMNS ARE HANDLED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER DTYPES ***
    Most importantly, if a binary integer has a value below threshold,
    the DEFAULT behavior is to not delete the respective rows (whereas
    any other dtype will delete the rows), essentially causing bin int
    columns with insufficient count to just be deleted.

    - classify uniques into two classes - 'zero' and 'non-zero'

    - if ignoring nan or no nans
        -- look at cts for the 2 classes, if any ct < thresh, mark all
            associated values for deletion if `delete_axis_0` is True
        -- if any class below thresh, DELETE COLUMN
    - if not ign nan and has nans if `delete_axis_0` is True
        -- treat nan like any other value
        -- look at cts for the 3 unqs (incl nan), if any ct < thresh,
            mark rows for deletion
        -- if any of the non-nan classes below thresh, DELETE COLUMN
    - if not ign nan and has nans if not `delete_axis_0`
        -- look at cts for the 2 non-nan classes, if any ct < thresh,
            DELETE COLUMN
        -- but if keeping the column (both above thresh) and nan ct
            less than thresh, delete the nans

    Parameters
    ----------
    _threshold : int
        The minimum threshold frequency for this column.
    _nan_key : Union[float, str, Literal[False]]
        The nan value found in the column. `_columns_getter` converts
        all nan-likes to numpy.nan.
    _nan_ct : Union[int, Literal[False]]
        The number of nan-like values found in the column.
    _COLUMN_UNQ_CT_DICT : dict[DataType, int]
        The value from `_total_cts_by_column` for this column, which is
        a dictionary containing the uniques and their frequencies, less
        any nan that may have been in it, and must have 2 non-nan uniques.
    _delete_axis_0 : bool
        Whether to delete the rows associated with any of the values
        that fall below the minimum frequency.

    Returns
    -------
    _instr_list : list[Union[Literal['DELETE COLUMN'], DataType]]
        The row and column operations for this column.
