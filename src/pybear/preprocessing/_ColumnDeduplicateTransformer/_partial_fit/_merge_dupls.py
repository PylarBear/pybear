    """Compare the newest duplicates found in the current partial fit
    with previous duplicates found on earlier partial fits and meld
    together to produce overall duplicates.

    Any columns previously not identified as equal but currently are
    equal, are coincidentally equal and are not added to the final list.
    Columns previously found to be equal but are not currently equal are
    removed from the final lists of duplicates. The only duplicates
    retained are those columns found to be identical for all partial
    fits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _previous_duplicates : Union[DuplicatesType, None]
        The duplicate columns carried over from the previous partial
        fits. Is None if on the first partial fit.
    _current_duplicates : DuplicatesType
        The duplicate columns found on the current partial fit.

    Returns
    -------
    duplicates_ : DuplicatesType
        The groups of identical columns, indicated by their zero-based
        column index positions.
