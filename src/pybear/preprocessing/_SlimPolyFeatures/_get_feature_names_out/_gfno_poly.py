    """Get feature names for the polynomial expansion component of the
    final output.

    Construct the polynomial feature names based on `feature_name_combiner`.
    If `min_degree` is 1, the feature names of X are prepended to the
    polynomial feature names (the output of this module) outside of this
    module.

    `_poly_feature_names` (the output of this) must match the order of
    `_active_combos`.

    `_active_combos` must be sorted first on asc tuple len (degree),
    then asc on the idxs in each tuple.

    If `_active_combos` is sorted correctly, then this output is sorted
    correctly at construction.

    `_active_combos` being sorted correctly depends on self._combos
    being sorted correctly.

    self._combos is built directly from itertools.combinations or
    `itertools.combinations_with_replacement`, and is sorted coming out
    of :func:`_combination_builder` to ensure the correct sort, in case
    itertools built-ins ever change.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X_feature_names_in : FeatureNamesInType
        The feature names of the original data.
    _active_combos : CombinationsType
        The tuples of column index combinations that will be in the
        outputted polynomial expansion.
    _feature_name_combiner : FeatureNameCombinerType, default='as_indices'
        Sets the naming convention for the created polynomial features.
        See the lengthy notes in the main SPF module.

    Returns
    -------
    _poly_feature_names: FeatureNamesInType
        The feature names for the polynomial expansion.
