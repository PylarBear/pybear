    """`SlimPolyFeatures` (SPF) performs a polynomial feature expansion
    on a dataset, where any feature produced that is a column of constants
    or is a duplicate of another column is omitted from the final output.

    SPF follows the standard scikit-learn transformer API, and makes the
    standard transformer methods available: `get_feature_names_out`,
    `fit`, `partial_fit`, `transform`, `fit_transform`, `set_params`,
    and `get_params`. SPF also has a `reset` method which is covered
    elsewhere in the docs.

    Numpy arrays, pandas dataframes, polars dataframes, and all scipy
    sparse objects (csr, csc, coo, lil, dia, dok, and bsr matrices
    and arrays) are accepted by :meth:`partial_fit`, :meth:`fit`,
    and :meth:`transform`. SPF only accepts numerical data, and will
    raise an exception if passed non-numerical values.

    SPF requires that data passed to it have no duplicate and no constant
    columns. This stipulation is explained in more detail later in
    the docs. If you are expanding non-binary integer or float data
    under this condition, there is low (but non-zero) likelihood that
    polynomial terms will be constant or duplicate. Therefore, SPF has
    the least utility for that type of data, and the user may be better
    off using scikit PolynomialFeatures, which has much lower cost of
    operation than SPF. SPF is of greatest benefit when it is used to
    perform polynomial expansion on one-hot encoded data, where there
    is high likelihood that polynomial terms are constant (all zeros)
    or duplicate.

    A polynomial feature expansion generates all possible multiplicative
    combinations of the original features, typically from the zero-degree
    term up to and including a specified maximum degree. For example, if
    a dataset has two features, called 'a' and 'b', then the degree-2
    polynomial expansion is [1, a, b, a^2, ab, b^2], where the column of
    ones is the zero-degree term, columns 'a' and 'b' are the first
    degree terms, and columns a^2, ab, and b^2 are the second degree
    terms. Generating these features for analysis is useful for finding
    non-linear relationships between the data and the target.

    A conventional workflow would be to perform a polynomial expansion
    (that fits in memory) on data, remove duplicate and constant columns,
    and perform an analysis. The memory occupied by the columns that were
    eventually removed may have prevented us from doing a higher order
    expansion, which may have provided useful information. Unfortunately,
    even low-degree polynomial expansions of modest-sized datasets
    quickly grow to consume large amounts, or maybe even all, available
    RAM. This limits the number of polynomial terms that can be analyzed.

    But there is opportunity to reduce memory footprint for a given
    expansion by not generating features that do not add value. Many
    polynomial expansions generate columns that are duplicate or
    constant (think columns of all zeros from interactions of a one-hot
    encoded feature). SPF finds columns such as these before the data
    is fully expanded and prevents them from ever appearing in the
    final array and occupying memory. This affords the opportunity to
    (possibly) work with more data and do higher order expansions than
    otherwise possible because the non-value-added columns are never even
    created. SPF also saves the time of manually finding and removing
    such columns after the expansion.

    To robustly and tractably do this, SPF requires that the dataset to
    undergo expansion has no duplicate or constant columns. There is
    further discussion in these documents about how SPF handles these
    conditions in-situ during multiple partial fits, but ultimately
    SPF requires that the totality of seen data has no constants and no
    duplicates. When `scan_X` is True, SPF is able to find any columns
    in the original data that are constant/duplicate and prevent
    transform until the condition is fixed; it could only be fixed
    in-situ with more partial fits. To properly pre-condition your
    data beforehand, remove constant columns from your data with
    pybear :class:`InterceptManager`, and remove duplicate columns from
    your data with pybear :class:`ColumnDeduplicator`. If there are no
    constant or duplicate columns in the data, setting `scan_X` to False
    can reduce the cost of the polynomial expansion. See more discussion
    in the `scan_X` parameter.

    During the fitting process, SPF learns what columns in the expansion
    would be constant and/or duplicate. SPF does the expansion out
    brute force, which can be expensive. Even with all that work, this
    preliminary expansion is not directly returned as a result at
    transform time. At transform, the polynomial expansion is built
    based on what was learned about constant and duplicate columns
    during the building of the preliminary expansion.

    At transform time, SPF applies the rules it learned during fitting
    and only builds the polynomial features that could add value to the
    dataset. The internal construction of the polynomial expansion is
    always as a scipy sparse csc array to minimize the RAM footprint
    of the expansion. The expansion is also always done with float64
    datatypes, regardless of datatype of the passed data, to prevent any
    overflow problems that might arise from multiplication of low bit
    number types. However, overflow is still possible with 64 bit
    datatypes, especially when the data has large values or the degree
    of the expansion is high. SPF HAS NO PROTECTIONS FOR OVERFLOW. IT IS
    UP TO THE USER TO AVOID OVERFLOW CONDITIONS AND VERIFY RESULTS.

    Even though `transform` always constructs the expansion as scipy
    sparse csc, SPF will return the expansion in the format of the data
    passed to `transform`, unless instructed otherwise. If dense data
    is passed to `transform`, this negates the memory savings from
    building as sparse csc because the sparse format will be converted
    to the dense format for return. SPF can be instructed to return
    the output in sparse format via the `sparse_output` parameter, which
    preserves the lower memory footprint of the internal expansion. If
    `sparse_output` is set to True, the expansion is returned as scipy
    sparse csr array. If `sparse_output` is set to False, then SPF will
    convert the polynomial expansion from a sparse csc array to the same
    format passed to `transform`.

    The SPF `partial_fit` method allows for incremental fitting. Through
    this method, even if the data is bigger-than-memory, SPF is able to
    learn what columns in `X` are constant/duplicate and what columns in
    the expansion are constant/duplicate, and carry out instructions to
    build the expansion batch-wise. This makes SPF amenable to batch-wise
    fitting and transforming via dask_ml Incremental and ParallelPostFit
    wrappers.

    SPF takes parameters to set the minimum (`min_degree`) and maximum
    (`degree`) degrees of the polynomial terms produced during the
    expansion. The edge case of returning only the 0-degree column of
    ones is disallowed. SPF never returns the 0-degree column of ones
    under any circumstance. The lowest degree SPF ever returns is degree
    one (the original data in addition to whatever other order terms are
    required). SPF terminates if `min_degree` is set to zero (minimum
    allowed setting is 1). To append a zero-degree column to your data,
    use pybear `InterceptManager` after using SPF. Also, SPF does not
    allow the no-op case of `degree` = 1, where the original data would
    be returned unchanged without any polyomial features. The minimum
    setting for `degree` is 2.

    When searching for constant and duplicate columns, SPF ONLY LOOKS IN
    WHAT IS TO BE RETURNED. That is, if you specify `min_degree` to be
    1, then SPF will compare the created polynomial terms against the
    original data and themselves. If you specify `min_degree` to be 2 or
    greater, SPF will only compare the created polynomial terms against
    themselves. The ramifications of the latter case is that if you were
    to merge your original data onto the SPF output, there may be
    duplicates.

    During fitting, SPF is able to tolerate constants and duplicates in
    the passed data. While this condition exists, however, SPF remains
    in a state where it waits for further partial fits to remedy the
    situation and does no-ops with warnings on most other actions (such
    as calls to attributes, `transform`, amongst others.) Only when the
    internal state of SPF is satisfied that there are no constant or
    duplicate columns in the training data will SPF allow access to the
    other functionality.

    SPF MUST ONLY TRANSFORM DATA IT HAS BEEN FITTED ON. TRANSFORMATION
    OF ANY OTHER DATA WILL PRODUCE OUTPUT THAT MAY CONTAIN CONSTANTS,
    DUPLICATES, AND NONSENSICAL RESULTS.

    SPF has 5 property attributes that are accessible at any point after
    fitting. They can only be accessed if there are no constants or
    duplicates in the training data, otherwise attempts to access them
    will result in a no-op that gives a warning and returns None.

    Once SPF is fit, setting of most params via :meth:`set_params` is
    blocked. This is to prevent SPF from failing because of new learning
    states that cannot be reconciled with earlier learning states. The
    only parameters that can be set after a fit are `keep`, `n_jobs`,
    `job_size`, `sparse_output`, and `feature_name_combiner`. SPF has
    a :meth:`reset` method that resets the data-dependent state of SPF.
    This allows for re-initializing the instance and setting different
    learning parameters without forcing the user to create a new instance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    degree : numbers.Integral, default=2
        The maximum polynomial degree of the generated features. The
        minimum value accepted by SPF is 2; the no-op case of simply
        returning the original degree-one data is not allowed.
    min_degree : numbers.Integral, default=1
        The minimum polynomial degree of the generated features.
        Polynomial terms with degree below `min_degree` are not included
        in the final output array. The minimum value accepted by SPF is
        1; SPF cannot be used to generate a zero-degree column (a column
        of all ones).
    interaction_only : bool, default=False
        If True, only interaction features are produced, that is,
        polynomial features that are products of 'degree' distinct input
        features. Terms with power of 2 or higher for any feature are
        excluded. If False, produce the full polynomial expansion.

        Consider 3 features 'a', 'b', and 'c'. If `interaction_only` is
        True, `min_degree` is 1, and `degree` is 2, then only the first
        degree interaction terms ['a', 'b', 'c'] and the second degree
        interaction terms ['ab', 'ac', 'bc'] are returned in the
        polynomial expansion.
    scan_X : bool, default=True
        SPF requires that the data being fit has no columns of constants
        and no duplicate columns. When `scan_X` is True, SPF does not
        assume that the analyst knows these states of the data and
        diagnoses them during fitting, which can be very expensive to do,
        especially finding duplicate columns. If the analyst knows that
        there are no constant or duplicate columns in the data, setting
        this to False can greatly reduce the cost of the polynomial
        expansion. When in doubt, pybear recommends setting this to True
        (the default). When this is False, it is possible to pass columns
        of constants or duplicates, but SPF will continue to operate
        under the assumptions of the stated design requirement, and the
        output will be nonsensical.
    keep : Literal['first', 'last', 'random'], default='first'
        The strategy for keeping a single representative from a set of
        identical columns in the polynomial expansion. This is overruled
        if a polynomial feature is a duplicate of one of the original
        features, as the original feature will always be kept and the
        polynomial duplicates will always be dropped. One of SPF's
        design rules is to never alter the originally passed data, so
        the original feature will always be kept. Under SPF's design rule
        that the original data has no duplicate columns, an expansion
        feature cannot be identical to 2 of the original features. In
        all cases where the duplicates are only within the polynomial
        expansion, 'first' retains the column left-most in the expansion
        (lowest degree); 'last' keeps the column right-most in the
        expansion (highest degree); 'random' keeps a single randomly
        selected feature of the set of duplicates.
    sparse_output : bool, default=True
        If set to True, the polynomial expansion is returned from
        `transform` as a scipy sparse csr array. If set to False, the
        polynomial expansion is returned in the same format as passed
        to `transform`.
    feature_name_combiner : FeatureNameCombinerType, default='as_indices'
        Sets the naming convention for the created polynomial features.
        This does not set nor change any original feature names that may
        have been seen during fitting on containers that have a header.

        `feature_name_combiner` must be literal 'as_feature_names',
        literal 'as_indices', or a user-defined function (callable) for
        mapping polynomial column index combination tuples to polynomial
        feature names.

        If literal 'as_feature_names' is used, SPF generates new
        polynomial feature names based on the feature names in the
        original data. For example, if the feature names of X are
        ['x0', 'x1', ..., 'xn'] and the polynomial column index
        tuple is (1, 1, 3), then the polynomial feature name is
        'x1^2_x3'.

        If the default literal 'as_indices' is used, SPF generates new
        polynomial feature names based on the polynomial column index
        tuple itself. For example, if the polynomial column index tuple
        is (2, 2, 4), then the polynomial feature name is '(2, 2, 4)'.

        If a user-defined callable is passed, it must:

            1) Accept 2 arguments
                a) a 1D vector of strings that contains the original feature
                    names of X, as is used internally in SPF,
                b) the polynomial column combination tuple, which is a tuple
                    of integers of variable length. The minimum length of
                    the tuple must be `min_degree`, and the maximum length
                    must be `degree`, with each integer falling in the range
                    of [0, `n_features_in_`-1]
            2) Return a string that
                a) is not a duplicate of any originally seen feature name
                b) is not a duplicate of any other polynomial feature name
    equal_nan : bool, default=False

        When comparing two columns for equality:

        If `equal_nan` is True, assume that a nan value would otherwise
        be the same as the compared non-nan counterpart, or if both
        compared values are nan, consider them as equal (contrary to the
        default numpy handling of nan, where numpy.nan != numpy.nan).
        If `equal_nan` is False and either one or both of the values in
        the compared pair of values is/are nan, consider the pair to be
        not equivalent, thus making the column pair not equal. This is
        in line with the normal numpy handling of nan values.

        When assessing if a column is constant:

        If `equal_nan` is True, assume any nan values equal the mean of
        all non-nan values in the respective column. If `equal_nan` is
        False, any nan-values could never take the value of the mean of
        the non-nan values in the column, making the column not constant.
    rtol : numbers.Real, default=1e-5
        The relative difference tolerance for equality. Must be a
        non-boolean, non-negative, real number. See numpy.allclose.
    atol : numbers.Real, default=1e-8
        The absolute difference tolerance for equality. Must be a
        non-boolean, non-negative, real number. See numpy.allclose.
    n_jobs : Union[numbers.Integral, None], default=None
        The number of joblib parallel jobs to use when looking for
        duplicate columns. The default is to use processes, but can be
        overridden externally using a joblib `parallel_config` context
        manager. The default number of jobs is None, which uses the
        joblib default setting. To get maximum speed benefit, pybear
        recommends using -1, which means use all processors.
    job_size : Optional[numbers.Integral], default=50
        The number of columns to send to a joblib job. Must be an integer
        greater than or equal to 2. This allows the user to optimize
        CPU utilization for their particular circumstance. Long, thin
        datasets should use fewer columns, and wide, flat datasets should
        use more columns. Bear in mind that the columns sent to joblib
        jobs are deep copies of the original data, and larger job sizes
        increase RAM usage. Note that joblib is only engaged in scanning
        the original data when the number of columns in the data is at
        least 2*job_size. Also, joblib is only engaged in scanning the
        polynomial expansion if the number of columns in it is at least
        2*job_size. For example, if `job_size` is 10, data with 20 or
        more columns will be processed with joblib, data with 19 or
        fewer columns will be processed linearly.

    Attributes

    n_features_in_ : int
        The number of features in the fitted data, i.e., number of
        features before expansion.

        The names of the features as seen during fitting. Only accessible
        if `X` is passed to :meth:`partial_fit` or :meth:`fit` in a
        container that has a header.

    Notes
    -----
    Concerning the handling of nan-like representations. SPF accepts
    data in the form of numpy arrays, pandas dataframes, polars
    dataframes, and scipy sparse matrices/arrays. Regardless of the
    format of the passed data, during the construction of the preliminary
    (learning) expansion and during transform columns are extracted from
    the data as a numpy array with float64 dtype (see below for more
    detail about how scipy sparse is handled.) After the conversion to
    numpy array and prior to calculating the products of the columns in
    the extraction, SPF identifies any nan-like representations in the
    extracted numpy array and standardizes all of them to numpy.nan.
    The user is advised that whatever is used to indicate 'not-a-number'
    in the original data must first survive the conversion to numpy
    array and then be recognized by SPF as nan-like, so that SPF can
    standardize it to numpy.nan. nan-like representations that are
    recognized by SPF include, at least, numpy.nan, pandas.NA, None (of
    type None, not string 'None'), and string representations of 'nan'
    (not case sensitive).

    Concerning the handling of infinity. SPF has no special handling for
    the various infinity-types, e.g, numpy.inf, -numpy.inf, float('inf'),
    float('-inf'), etc. This is a design decision to not force infinity
    values to numpy.nan. SPF falls back to the native handling of these
    values for Python and numpy. Specifically, numpy.inf==numpy.inf and
    float('inf')==float('inf').

    Concerning the handling of scipy sparse arrays. When constructing
    the preliminary (learning) expansion and during transform, the
    columns extracted from the data are converted to dense numpy
    arrays via the 'toarray' method, then undergo multiplication.
    This a compromise that causes some memory expansion but allows
    for efficient handling of polynomial calculations.
