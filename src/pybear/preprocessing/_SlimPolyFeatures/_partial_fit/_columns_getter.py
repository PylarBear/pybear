    """Handles the mechanics of extracting and multiplying polynomial
    columns from the various allowed data container types.

    The container must be numpy ndarray, pandas dataframe, polars
    dataframe, or scipy csc only. Return extracted column(s) as a numpy
    array in row-major order. In the case of scipy sparse, the columns
    are converted to dense.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X : InternalXContainer
        The data to extract columns from. The container must be numpy
        ndarray, pandas dataframe, polars dataframe, or scipy csc only.
        This module expects `_X` to be in a valid state when passed, and
        will not condition it.
    _col_idxs : Union[tuple[int, ...], CombinationsType]
        The column index / indices to extract from `_X`.

    Returns
    -------
    _columns : NDArray[np.float64]
        The columns and/or polynomial columns from `_X` corresponding to
        the given indices in row-major order.
