    _new_duplicates: PolyDuplicatesType,
) -> PolyDuplicatesType:
    """Compare the newest duplicates found in the current partial fit
    with duplicates found on earlier partial fits and meld together to
    produce overall duplicates.

    The lead-up to this module:

    Within a partial fit, for all combos get the duplicates
    with :func:`_get_dupls_for_combo_in_X_and_poly`. Convert the output
    format with :func:`pybear.utilities.union_find`. The output of
    `union_find` is the final list of duplicates for the current
    partial fit. Merge the current partial fit's dupls with dupls from
    previous partial fits with this module.

    Any combos previously not identified as equal but currently are
    equal, are coincidentally equal and are not added to the final list.
    Combos previously found to be equal but are not currently equal are
    removed from the final lists of duplicates. The only duplicates
    retained are those combos found to be identical for all partial fits.

    The merged duplicates must be sorted in this way:

    All combos should already be sorted asc on indices. Within each
    group of duplicates, sort first on tuple len (degree), then sort asc
    on idx values. Across groups of duplicates sort in the same way on
    the first value in each group, so that the groups are asc on degree,
    then on indices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _old_duplicates : Union[PolyDuplicatesType, None]
        The duplicate combos carried over from the previous partial fits.
        Is None if on the first partial fit.
    _new_duplicates : PolyDuplicatesType
        The duplicate combos found during the current partial fit.

    Returns
    -------
    duplicates_ : PolyDuplicatesType
        The groups of identical combos across all partial fits.
