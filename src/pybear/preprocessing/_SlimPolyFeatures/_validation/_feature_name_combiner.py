def _val_feature_name_combiner(
    _feature_name_combiner: FeatureNameCombinerType,
) -> None:
    """Validate `_feature_name_combiner`.

    Must be:

    1) Literal 'as_feature_names'
    2) Literal 'as_indices
    3) a callable that takes as input:
        A) a 1D vector of strings (the feature names of X)
        B) a variable-length tuple of integers (the polynomial column
            indices combination tuple for a single poly feature),
        and always returns a string.

    The output of `_feature_name_combiner` is tested directly for the
    actual kept combos at the point of poly feature name generation
    in :func:`_gfno_poly`. The tested characteristics:

    1) returns a string
    2) the returned string is not already in the original feature names
    3) the returned string is not already in the new poly feature names

    Parameters
    ----------
    _feature_name_combiner : FeatureNameCombinerType, default='as_indices'
        Sets the naming convention for the created polynomial features.

        See the lengthy notes in the main SPF module.

    Returns
    -------
    None
