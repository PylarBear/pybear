    param_grid:
        dict[str, list-like] or list[dict[str, list-like]] - Dictionary
        with keys as parameters names (str) and values as lists of para-
        meter settings to try as values, or a list of such dictionaries.
        When multiple param grids are passed in a list, the grids spanned
        by each dictionary in the list are explored. This enables
        searching over any sequence of parameter settings.
