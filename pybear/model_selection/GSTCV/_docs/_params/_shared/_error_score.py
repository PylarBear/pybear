    error_score:
        Union[int, float, Literal['raise']], default='raise' - Score to
        assign if an error occurs in estimator fitting. If set to
        ‘raise’, the error is raised. If a numeric value is given, a
        warning is raised and the error score value is inserted into the
        subsequent calculations in place of the missing value(s). This
        parameter does not affect the refit step, which will always raise
        the error.
