different than validation of __init__ args/kwargs

this validation will reject any invalid args/kwargs, fulfilling that purpose for
args/kwargs passed to __init__, but continues on to convert the values into forms
for internal GSTCV uses.
therefore, values coming out of these validation modules are not necessarily
the same as those given or as retrieved via get_params. which means the
validation of outputs here is not the same as the validation of outputs retrieved
via get_params when testing __init__ validation.
