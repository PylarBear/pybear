# CREATING LIST OF DENSE IDXS AND VALUES USING serialized_dense_locations HAS TWO LIMITATIONS:
# 1) THE np.random.choice FUNCTION WITHIN CANT HANDLE LOOKING IN SIZE > 100M
# 2) FOR ALL SIZES AND SPARSITIES, PULLING THE LIST OF DENSE IDXS AND VALUES USING np.random.choice TAKES AT BEST 1.6X
#   LONGER THAN use_fully_sized_ndarray_w_mask DOES TO GENERATE A FULLY SIZED DENSE np array, GENERATE A FULLY SIZED
#   RANDOM MASK OF 1s AND 0s, AND APPLY THE MASK.
# THE ONLY THING THAT COULD REDEEM serialized IS IF MAPPING THE DENSE IDXS AND VALUES (THAT TAKE LONGER TO
# MAKE) TO A SPARSE DICT GOES MUCH FASTER THAN ZIPPING A FULLY SIZED np array TO SPARSE DICT. (IT DOESNT, SLOWER TOO).
